{"id": 4698, "text": "Every now and again a cinema house comes out with a film so good it makes you want to weep and this is one of those films. Set in 1980's Glasgow and featuring a typically acerbic and avant garde Glaswegian screenplay, the film concerns the adventures of Gregory (failed soccer striker cum goalie) and his pursuit of Dorothy, the dashingly glamorous new addition to the school team. The course of false love refuses to run smooth of course and Gregory reels from being stood up and jilted by Dorothy, only to be gently coerced into the waiting arms of his secret admirer, Susan. There's some superb performances in this film from the wonderfully frustrated John Gordon Sinclair as Gregory, plus Dee Hepburn as Dorothy the stunning love interest. 'Gregory's Girl' was clearly filmed between Spring and early Autumn and there's one enduringly beautiful scene where Dorothy plays keep-up with a soccer ball, shot against the maternally basking backdrop of urban Glasgow, whilst a haunting saxophone laments and chases the fading daylight, bemoaning the inevitable and eventual closure of our younger years, brief and fleeting as the scene itself. Plenty of valiant support too from Robert Buchanan as Charlie who finds himself fresh out of luck with the ladies and is therefore reduced to irritation tactics in a vain attempt to court their favours, all of which goes wrong and he attempts to hitchhike from StrathClyde to 'Caracus', where he's heard that the women out number the men by 8 to 1. Clare Grogan is slow-burningly sexy as Susan and a special mention too for Allison Forster for her brilliant betrayal of Gregory's dour and deadpan sister Madeline. Watch out for a wandering and periodic cameo penguin, some 'Olympic-challenged' track and field events and the late Chic Murray as the Headmaster ..\"off you go you small boys\". The film also shows all the hilarious vice rackets that existed around 80's schools during lunch breaks, plus the pompous 'cock of the walk' bravado that naturally seems to accompany young men around the fairer sex. I was saddened to note that 'Gregory's Girl' was the one and only on-screen appearance that some of the cast have made and I believe that to be a crying shame as the cast was talented beyond belief. That said however, this is a magnificent statement of young love from start to finish and everyone of any age currently in love (or theoretically), ought to see it, sooner rather than later.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 28702, "text": "Directed by Oscar nominee James L. Brooks, the story written by Mark Andrus brings up not only very interesting characters but also very interesting issues. I have the video and enjoy watching it. The CD is great with music of Nat King Cole, Shawn Colkin. Outstanding acting by Helen Hunt (Mad About You, Twister) who won an Oscar for this role where she plays Carol Connelly, a single mother, working as waitress in Manhattan, New York. A single parent trying to cope with her work and paying medical bills for son Spencer Connelly, played by Jesse James (Message in a Bottle, The Gingerbread Men, Gods and Monsters). Jack Nicholson (A Few Good Men, Easy Rider, Witches of Eastwick) is Melvin Udall who is an obsessive compulsive. Nicholson also won an Oscar for his part. His obsessive compulsiveness has taken over his life and he is not able to live a normal life. Melvin Udall has tons of soap all organized in his medicine cabinet. He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out. He will not step on a crack on the side walk but skips to the next block of concrete. When he goes to the restaurant he brings his own plastic fork, knife and spoon in a plastic bag. Udall uses plastic gloves to hold the dog and has all his office supply stacked and all color coordinated in his home/office. He eats at the same restaurant, sits at the same table, if someone is seating at his table he insults them to make them leave so that he has his table back, wants the same waiter Carol to wait on him, and takes forever to take a shower. He closes his door several times and counts how many times he has done it. As a writer who works at home I do understand Mr. Udall really well. Writers think somewhat like this: we like to be alone with ourselves in order to think. We have to go inside ourselves to produce good work. It is a very isolated world. We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone. This is somehow like Melvin thinks. People think that he has nothing to do and they keep knocking at his door and he gets really aggravated about that. He is my favorite character in this movie, not to diminish the other ones. He is just so full on nuances that make him very entertaining. Helen's role is very, very, good and she did a really good job with it. Greg Kinnear (Sabrina) is Simon Bishop, the artist who is Udall's next door neighbor who finally has Melvin turning into a little more normal human being and he is there to teach him many life lessons. The supporting actors are great, you have Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. (Jerry Maguire) playing Frank Sachs, Simon's agent.<br /><br />My favorite scenes: elementary school kids all in uniform screaming: \"Wait! Melvin, wait\"! Greg Kinnear imitating Melvin. Melvin and Caroll going to eat fresh rolls in the wee hours of the morning. When Melvin realizes that the dog is also skipping cracks on the sidewalk.<br /><br />My favorite quote: \"I am drowning here and you are describing the water.\" This is a nice story telling movie.

{"id": 12025, "text": "This is a chilling film made with minimal resources that grabs you by the jugular and doesn't let go - a family tragedy that reeks of Shakespeare. A father has died leaving two sets of sons behind (by different mothers). The older sons were abandoned when young and when they turn up at the funeral held by the younger sons, old hostilities surface. Much of the narrative unfolds without explicit explanation, and often with minimal dialogue. We get into the minds of the various protagonists largely by their actions.<br /><br />Set in the cotton-growing region of Arkansas, it gives a view of Americans struggling in semi-rural life. The film cast is mostly with unknown actors and this is a strength that adds a level of realism to a film. While there is a sense of dreaded inevitability throughout, there is also plenty of room for the unexpected, but not in a contrived Hollywood manner. The film is both very well written and impeccably directed. Remarkably, this is a directorial debut by Jeff Nichols who also wrote and produced the film. He is definitely a talent to watch.<br /><br />As a slight negative, I don't know if it was the film or the venue, but the visuals and sound didn't seem quite up to scratch.

{"id": 17643, "text": "I actually enjoyed this movie's portrayal of life with a severely autistic child. I loved the mom's mouthy way of dealing with her life and her reality. I could easily relate to her life and the way she was handling things. I could also understand her amazement at finding that her son could do more than she thought he could.<br /><br />But having the movie end with her putting her child into an institution and walking out the door.... and her final speech to her son where she tells him that she has been holding him back... that spoiled it for me a bit.<br /><br />This movie's very unfortunate message seems to be that it is the mother's fault that her child is autistic and the best thing for autistic children is to go live in an institution and the best thing for moms of autistic children is to put their children in an institution and get out and have a life. There is also a point made that moms who don't want to put their children into an institution are just using their kids to make themselves feel special.<br /><br />I believe that this movie is a very good representation of 1994. Kirstie Alley did a fantastic job of conveying the complex emotions involved in raising a child who simultaneously needs her desperately and barely acknowledges her existence.<br /><br />The speech that she gave when her husband was leaving her was exactly right. We do what we have to do no matter how hard it is to do. And the unfortunate truth is that most fathers of special needs kids do leave. They can't handle it and they give up, leaving it all to the mother to handle on her own. And by the time some actually nice man comes along who wants to accept and help and be part of the family the mother is so worn out she cannot feel anything except what must be done. The complex combination of hope and despair was beautifully portrayed here.<br /><br />I would love to see this movie made again with the same cast but with a different ending. I would like to see the mom find a school that was during the day only to take care of and teach her son and then she could have her days free to pursue her own interests. She could see her son's progress and learn how to help him learn life skills at home. As she begins to relax and have more hope and less despair on a daily basis she becomes able to reconnect with her own self again.<br /><br />Of course I love Kirstie Alley, Stockard Channing and Sam Waterston so much I would watch those three do just about anything.

{"id": 12866, "text": "Timeslip is one of many science fiction series from the 1970's. However, crucially it is also one of the best, standing the test of time better than say the excruciatingly cheap but entertaining romp that was the Tomorrow People or the imaginative fantasy series The Ace of Wands. Created by Ruth Boswell and husband James Boswell, the series focused on crucial issues in an increasingly technological age and did so all under the banner of a serious children's television drama, which for its time was really quite something. Aimed as a rival to the BBC's Doctor Who, the Boswell's and excellent television writer Bruce Stewart produced something entirely different from what was available on British television at the time. Doomwatch - the gritty and often rather lacklustre series covering moral, social and environmental issues was the only programme that came close to Timeslip at this time, but Timeslip was overall much more successful. The premise of the story - a young girl finding a time barrier at an abandoned naval station - is truly intriguing, add in some atmospheric direction from a team of excellent directors, sparse but brilliantly executed location footage and some solid performances - special note goes to the flawless and concentrated performance of Denis Quilley as Commander Traynor and you have a remarkably entertaining and memorable series. The regulars, intrigued by local gossip about the young girl and drawn to the time barrier were an excellent choice as central characters - as children from 1970 could instantly relate to them. Simon, portrayed by the excellent child actor Spencer Banks is the brainy one, interested in science and maths, with an instinct for discovery he single-handedly figures out all the crucial plot points for the audience to absorb, whilst (rather unfortunately) the naive and whining Liz, played by the admirable Cheryl Burfield, whines a little longer. In this respect the serial has dated - but the concepts and ideas put forward, and its ability to predict many future issues put the series way ahead of its time. Timeslip is quite simply 26 episodes of virtually flawless television. Throw away the minor grumbles about the sexist interpretation of Liz and the opening stories slightly laboured execution and delve in. The Wrong End of Time is a fantastic instalment in which one of our central protagonists encounters her father in a 1940's naval station - coincidentally where the time barrier stands in 1970's England - and with the first appearance of Commander Traynor - a character so crucial to the overall story. The Time of the Ice Box gives viewers a terrible insight into future earth - and Liz's alter ego Beth. One of the strongest stories of all - The Year of the Burn Up gives us an equally bleak presentation of future earth - Buckinghamshire turned into an Amazonian jungle, with the issue of climate change being brought to the fore - and all this occurring as a possible projection (like the Ice Box) of the Earth in 1990. The final story - written by the excellent Victor Pemberton - effortlessly following on from Bruce Stewart - addresses the importance of individuality and the limits of genetic progress - with another appearance of the excellent John Barron as Devereaux and a marvellous final twist concerning the malevolent and untrustworthy Commander Traynor. And so after 26 episodes, the series ended. Could it have ran for another series? ........ Quite possibly - but what we have is truly special, consistently brilliant, consistently thought provoking and remarkably well made for its small budget, skillfully avoiding ambitious special effects and concentrating on character, mood and atmosphere. Timeslip is a slice of television gold - one of the best TV series of its time. So sit back relax, and watch the excellent DVD set of all 26 episodes.

Hats off to both writers (Craig Chester, Alan Hines) as well as the screenplay work by Robert Desiderio. The directing, filming and acting were outstanding. The story is a beautiful discussion of both the goodness and healing qualities of the Christian faith, while also exploring the brittle, rigid quality that faith by rules brings to the table. It does perhaps the best job I've ever seen of painting the complexity of homosexuality and Christianity, as well as the intricate dance that has developed between the two.<br /><br />I am in particular struck by the roles played by the two males leads (Chad Allen and Robert Gant) and the nuanced, powerful performance by Judith Light. The transitions Allen makes from addict/bad boy to hopeful believer to the beginnings of a healthy gay relationship are brilliant. Robert Gant does exceptional work in the wrestling with the need to please a father he'll never win approval from, and in the dialogues where he confronts (in the person of Judith Light) the issues around Christianity, homosexuality and what it means to be a whole person. And Judith Light is a character I believe only a Christian or ex-Christian can deeply appreciate - believer, teacher, mother in denial for the way she feels she failed her son, defender, injured soul.

As a result, he seems to be in a different movie, so at least this one doesn't embarrass him like the luckless other performers. <br /><br />Jennifer Beals has the right droning, narcotic quality in scenes where she's the hypnotic face/voice of sinister advertisements, but elsewhere she has to rely on her acting abilities, which are limited as usual. Jan Niklas has apparently been excellent elsewhere, but he's dreadful here as the noirishly cynical investigating hero. Andrew McCarthy has exactly one brief scene as an assassin--he does get special billing, but it's neither a cameo or supporting role, just a straight-up bit part (I hope he fired his agent after this).<br /><br />Many people have said this film doesn't make much sense. and I'll have to take their word for it--it's so turgid I might well have not paying attention if/when there were elements that did somehow explain things. There's an inexplicable suicide epidemic in a faintly futuristic Berlin. Like Francois Truffault before him (in \"Fahrenheit 451\"), Chabrol has no particular feel for sci-fi or dystopian fantasy, despite OK production design. He doesn't even try to build suspense around the possibility of sudden violent death at any moment, and the deaths when they occur are indifferently staged.) There are ridiculous scenes in a quasi-fascist quasi-punk club where everyone dresses in designer black; they dance like performance artists trying cluelessly to imitate a mosh pit. There's also one of those hysterically pretentious sex scenes in which naked gyrations (Beals no doubt using a body double) are intercut with archival footage of nuclear explosions, war crimes, etc. Oh, the humanity. Things get even sillier when the protagonists go to a bizarre \"resort\"--hence the retitling \"Club Extinction\"--that's like Club Med meets Jonestown meets \"The Prisoner.\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, the whole film is so misconceived and lifeless there's little camp entertainment value to its mess.

Though it would be easy for somebody to say that it is a metaphor for our day and time with terrorist threats and all, but somebody even could do that with Cheaper by the Dozen. So anyway about Feast, it's a great film to watch.<br /><br />The premise is very simple a bunch of strangers are locked in a bar for the night as monsters try and get in. There really isn't much more to it and that is where the beauty of this film lies. I have heard that Marcus, one of the writers described this as a movie that you start watching on TBS at 2 am and you don't finish, which is a great description for it. <br /><br />The performances are pretty strong because the actors seem so relaxed in them. The best performances come from Balthazar Getty, Duane Whitaker, Clu Gulgar, Krista Allen, and Josh Zuckerman. The work of the Thomas L Callaway the cinematographer is great, especially in the final showdown scene, some may complain about not being able to see but the red color that covers the scene is great. The final shot of Krista Allen behind the rising sun is just beautiful, even if it is only a simple horror movie. <br /><br />The main credit goes to John Gulager, whom despite all the \"drama\" shown on Project Greenlight, has crafted a really enjoyable film. He took all the raw elements of the production and crafted just an amazing final product. This is a movie that I will suggest to people who just want to enjoy themselves in a theater.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 24209, "text": "I attended the premiere midnight screening of this film at the Toronto Film Festival last night and would have to say I'm severely disappointed. Going in, I had moderate to good expectations considering the talent and pedigree of the director's involved, and my hopes were dashed almost immediately. I highly respect these filmmaker's, but you get the feeling watching this that they didn't have a lot of creative control overall.<br /><br />One thing must be made clear at this point: although a team of director's collaborated, it was all written by one man. And shot by the same cinematographer. And edited by the same team. These three areas (as well as the acting) are what really bring the film down. It's lazily written, unoriginal and clichéd to a fault. Everything is there, and we've seen it all before.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm being too harsh, as it was mentioned that this is a throwback to the Amicus and Hammer anthology pictures, but I digress - those films at least felt alive. This is a movie with no real characters, just carcitures to get dispatched as the writing sees fit.<br /><br />The various cameos are fun, but they wink too much at the audience and in some cases (like the random transformation of a security guard into Dick Miller) are absolutely pointless.<br /><br />SPOILERS: There are entertaining ideas, but they've all been done before: killer transplants, vengeful spirits, immortal succubi, killer aborted twin... the list goes on. Worst of all is the ending, in which the character I'll just call \"Grandpa Exposition\" openly says \"you each forgot the endings of your own story\" and then explains how.... drum-roll... everyone is dead ad caught in some kind of limbo (it's a twist you could predict by reading the name of the film).<br /><br />Altogether it is a waste of two hours and a lot of talent.

Vic Rondell the new fire chief has just arrived, and when one snake attack after another occurs.

Not helping out is that it's not bad enough to be hilarious, of course stupidity fills nearly every moment and everything about it is clumsy. However it doesn't have that schlock presence or any sense of fun. The low-rent script (supposedly written by John Carpenter in the 70s) throws a bit of everything into the contrived premise, but in the long run it's a poisonous venture that's witless and incredibly textbook stuff. Director Noel Nosseck does a real nothing job with it, and makes sure you're in for something of extreme blandness, poor pacing and tired false jumps. While the deaths are mostly random there's no suspense, nor thrills. Nothing is sustained or delivered, because they are poorly staged and too goofy to have any sort of effect. While the obnoxious score gets in the way. A special mention though, at least they didn't succumb to digital effects for the snakes. We even get some snake vision, using a red filter. Strange the title actually makes no sense, since we're talking about rattlesnakes here. The no-frills performances are your standard mould found in these features and so are their stock characters.

It's very frustrating reading some of them. Why do people compare them? Why do they look for faults? Why do they not see and praise the positive aspects and ease up on critical commentary? It's like comparing apples & oranges & bananas & strawberries, etc. Comparing a film to the book or a previous film seems overly critical to me. It always bothered me when Siskel & Ebert & Roeper, et al. rated films as bad or good...thumbs up or down...see it or don't see it. Streets of Laredo is a perfect example. A lot of superb work was put into this fascinating sequel by the director, the cinematographer, the actors, the music composer, the art directors and more. It deserves more than comparisons with the equally superb mini-series Lonesome Dove and its fabulous other sequels. James Garner's Woodrow Call was terrific, so was Tommy Lee Jones' but is it fair to compare them? Cissy Spacek's Lorena was just as good as Diane Lane's as were Sam Shephard's and Tim Scott's Pea Eye interpretations. How do you rate cake and pie? Is one better than the other? Should you condemn it to thumbs down or tell others to avoid it? Maybe to some people this is the way. One constant in all the LD sequels is Larry McMurtry's brilliant characterizations. And don't complain about character development. It takes time to develop a character's nuances and profile. E.G Archie Bunker, Mary Richards, Barney Miller and friends. How long a movie do you want to watch? To wrap it up, Streets of Laredo is a superb film with great acting, directing, cinematography, and a stirring musical score and more.

{"id": 14570, "text": "It is difficult to watch this film and not read fairly obvious political implications into almost everything that happens. But what is most striking is the role of terrorism at the heart of the story. All of the characters revolve in orbit around Vietnamese events that keep popping - or should I say, blowing - up in the most unexpected places. And nothing is ever really resolved. Not even the crime at the center of the story.<br /><br />To read each character as a political paradigm is almost too easy, and if the film has a major flaw, it is that the characters are a bit too starkly drawn as representing their nationalities and not unique personalities. The American, who isn't very quiet at all, by the way, is brash and forward. He is the new kid who blunders around, intruding on murky relationships with the naiveté of the guileless, the Lone Ranger completely out of his element. Audie Murphy does a fine job portraying him, the lack of subtlety in his acting style perfectly complementing his character.<br /><br />Michael Redgrave is wordy and unctuous as the British journalist, Fowler, who is having an affair with a beautiful but ultimately vacuous Vietnamese girl, Phuong (Giorgia Moll). He is duplicitous and double-dealing, but also naive in his own ways. Clearly worn out and trying to save something permanent from the wreckage of his time in Vietnam, Fowler keeps grasping for happiness without ever understanding that can never happen. The main difference between Fowler and the American is that Fowler has longstanding ties to people and places in Saigon. He has come as close to \"going native\" as he can without losing his identity completely. The energetic American has no such ties, but eagerly seeks to rupture the Old World ties and make them his own. Obviously, this sets up conflict that cannot be resolved amicably. The Old World vs. the New, battling to dominate a country that itself is beginning to find dominance disturbing. In essence, all three parties have an agenda, and only one can fulfill it.<br /><br />The Old World Fowler lies to everyone, even to himself, to keep things as they are. The status quo is important to him because he realizes that the inevitable change he is denying will not be to his advantage. The American, on the other hand, is painfully honest in a charismatic but ultimately empty way. As Fowler remarks, it would be better for the American if he had a few faults of his own, then he might understand others better. Which is a very charitable view of the American. Fowler at least understands himself and his depravity, whereas the American just seems to understand empty concepts like self-determination and national longings without any hint of introspection or where those fine words ultimately must lead.<br /><br />The film is talky, and if you are not engaged by Fowler's various moral dilemmas and conflicts, it can get tedious. The scenes of Saigon are the film's best part, it is quite incredible to see how advanced and almost elegant Saigon was before the American involvement and Communist takeover. Too bad the film was not shot in color. Very civilized settings are ravaged by terrorist bombs, which may have seemed novel and exotic in the 1950s, but unfortunately seems quite common now.<br /><br />The story itself is incredibly far-sighted. Terrorism is a modern concept, and thinking that its practitioners always lose in the end is as naive as the Americans thinking they can pick a winner in Vietnam. Fowler, while full of profundity and fancy words, is used by the Communists to get out the story they want known. He dutifully complies, the perfect tool, without hindering their activities in the slightest. Meanwhile, his world collapses and he loses everything he had in the city. The American loses, too, but in quite a different way. But you know that others like him will be back. Who wins? Well, the answer to that should be obvious.<br /><br />Worth seeing at least once.

Except for Leatherface, none of the previous characters from the Hooper movies are present. They even decided to add a little girl and a mother to the family. The other characters from the family are confusing. Who are or were they?!?! But for a movie called LEATHERFACE, the character of Leatherface is remarkably flat and boring. He comes across as Jason from the FRIDAY THE 13TH series, or The Undertaker from WWF. And his mask is terrible. Leatherface in this movie is not the Leatherface we all know and love from the Hooper movies. And the other characters, the victims, are annoying or trite. And to make things even more flat, the movie wasn't even shot in Texas. Looks like California to me.<br /><br />I'm hesitating to call LEATHERFACE TCM 3 the worst TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies because I watched TCM 4 after this one.

The older husbands attitude is perhaps not unique as many older men respond to their wives or partners in a similar way and would be aroused and want to allow their younger partners to explore with their help and assistance. At the time the film was released however attitudes were not nearly as liberal as they are in the 2000s it was not so much the films content but what it silently inferred that was to shake people up and to raise questions their own minds.So that we focused on was it right for her \"Emannuelle\" to be touched by another woman, to have multiple hetro sex, or to be anally penetrated? these were serious issues in the 1997s some even illegal.

(Although I felt that \"Knock Off was mildly enjoyable, Hark's off-kilter approach and the 3rd rate screenplay made it tank big-time with American audiences). <br /><br />It's not that the movie itself was all that bad to look at.It's obviously the work of professionals. The hyper-kinetic camera work and meth-driven action sequences are pretty much what we've come to expect from Hark and his colleagues, there's some reasonably witty give and take in the dialog, a few decent one liners, etc., the actors are reasonably buff, etc. I tried to take all this into account, and all these mitigating elements help a little, but in the end, \"Double Team\" is obviously the Beginning Of The End. <br /><br />Why?? Well, we've always known the Van Damme isn't an Actor, he's a Body (like, say, Marc Singer in \"Beast Master\"). He's only believable in a limited range of roles, and he's very limited in his dramatic range of emotions ( the thick accent has always been a hindrance ). And \"Double Team\" pretty much signaled that Hollywood had run out of things to do with him, that his fan base and audience was pretty much played out, and that every VD film from now on would be a retread or a derivative, 2nd rate mishegoss. Three major directors had made a shot at bringing him into the mainstream (\"Hard Target\", \"Time Cop\", and \"Sudden Death\"), and Van Damme had been decent-to-excellent in all of them...but all those directors had moved on and Van Damme was now back to making \"B\" movie fodder. <br /><br />Or in the case of \"Double Team\" a 'freak show buddy movie' whose gimmick was that it starred Dennis Rodman as a giant Dennis Rodman. Rodman's whole gimmick as a celebrity (as opposed to his inarguable talent as a pro basketball player) is that he is \"outrageous\", and the movie stops repeatedly to let him BE outrageous, with various hi tech gimmicks and basketball-themed weapons that seemed to have been invented by your ninth-grade nephew. There are some potentially funny and incisive lines , but the delivery (by both Van Damme and Rodman) pretty much just lies there. Van Damme is particularly \"off\" in this movie, like he's just going through the motions until his hangover subsides or something. <br /><br />So it's not a \"real\" movie, but just a strung together series of set pieces with testosterone-fueled muscle flexing and an almost complete lack of actual human emotion or feeling. Oh, a certain kind of audience will love this kind of thing, but somehow, this particular movie seemed to permanently typecast Van Damme as a 2nd rater, a hack actor in the same vein as Rutger Hauer, Dolph Lundgren and, yes, Steven Seagal...All these actors also started off with a big splash in well designed vehicles that showcased their talents...and then faded into B-to-Z movie hackdom as the casting agencies and action directors moved on to other, fresher faces. <br /><br />For all his limitations as an actor and an action star, I've always enjoyed Van Damme - he's good looking, he is capable of mild wit and self deprecating humor, and he works hard at maintaining his physique in a career phase where a lot of his action star peers from the same period have let themselves go and have to suck their guts in and hope for a good camera angle.

I`m sorry but I was convinced that British army infantry regiments of the period were composed of \" Pals battalions \" , that is battalions composed entirely of men from the same home town . Take for instance the 16th battalion of The Royal Scots which was formed in one week and was called \" The Hearts battalion \" because it was composed mainly of supporters of Hearts football club . The 16th Royal Scots even had 16 Hearts players in its ranks so I don`t believe for a moment that any British army infantry platoon was as regionally mixed as the one here <br /><br />The more THE TRENCH goes on the more I found myself questioning the accuracy of the movie especially its mood and its sense of time and place . A British made trench in France in 1916 . Since when did the Brits build trenches like the one seen here ? It even has a concrete floor that the Germans would have been proud of which seems to go against I`ve seen in photographic evidence . The film also has an anachronistic cynical air , what on the eve of the Somme ? The British troops had witnessed day upon day of hellish bombardment of the German positions and a lot of British soldiers had begun to feel rather sorry for Jerry , and no one but no one in the British lines had any reason to doubt anything less than a swift , spectacular British victory . Of course one day and 20,000 dead British soldiers later changed these thoughts , in fact some historians describe the date 1st of July 1916 \" The day British idealism died \" . One final point - As at least one other commentator mentioned THE TRENCH contains a large amount of swear words . It has been documented that one criticism by the real life survivors of BAND OF BROTHERS was that the HBO/BBC drama contained too much swearing and that people in the 1940s used far less profane words than people use nowadays . I`m inclined to believe them and I`m also inclined to believe people in 1916 probably swore less than people in the 1940s so I doubt if the men in the trenches used the \" F \" word in every sentence <br /><br />Unfortunately who German bullets didn`t claim on that grim day have been killed by the passing of time so the chances of someone who was there writing into this site and telling us their opinion of THE TRENCH are very remote .

Ok, that's biologically possible, but married, too, at that age?<br /><br />This movie was suppose to be about a married woman being tempted by a younger man. Jason Momoa is very sexy and sensual. Who wouldn't be tempted? So where were the hot, steamy love scenes??? There was some kissing, but I never felt any heat between them. Besides Jason Momoa, the only other thing good about this movie was the beautiful Hawaiian location.<br /><br />I rate it 2 out of 10.", "sentiment": 0}

This movie shows both of them in top-form and they make this movie a fun and certainly above average one.<br /><br />It's not the most clever or best comedy movie even written but the movie does serve its purpose. There are quite many different plot-lines. It doesn't make the movie confusing to watch but it does make it a little bit less interesting to watch at times. Therefor the move never really reaches the level of true greatness but it still is a bit of a forgotten and certainly underrated comedy that deserves some more recognition.<br /><br />This movie features Steve Martin in one of his best and most entertaining roles. He is perfect as the ex-gangster, who now is in the witness protection program. He goes perfectly over-the-top as the Italian wise-guy. Rick Moranis' role is a bit smaller (too small) but not any less entertaining because of that. Moranis and Martin form a pretty good and funny comical duo, mainly because the two characters are very different from each other. The movie also has a really strong supporting cast, with some big and well known respected names in it.<br /><br />It's a movie that really mostly relies on its two main character. They make the movie and its comedy moments work. The movie doesn't really have that many memorable moments, although the dance sequences are definitely fun, original and amusing. Its more the sort of movie that amuses and entertaining throughout its entire running time, without making a too big or lasting impression. The movie tries to be clever at moments with its story but it only succeeds partly in this. The story is too messy and too disconnected to make it really fully work.<br /><br />There are too many issues with this movie to really regard it as a great comedy classic. The story is not always told in the most interesting way and not everything in the movie really connects with each other. Also the ending was a bit of a disappointment. It was like they wanted to solve every plot line and problems in the last ten minutes in just a couple of sequences. It made the ending a bit of a too easy and unsatisfying one.<br /><br />Overall an entertaining, bit of underrated comedy, that is fun to watch, mainly thanks to Martin and Moranis who were both in top shape at the time of this movie.<br /><br />7/10", "sentiment": 0}

In fact, one could argue that the only out-and-out stinker in that opening set of shows is 'The Alternative Factor,' which is confusing to the point of being incomprehensible at times. The universe is in danger of 'winking out,' and if you find the explanation of this phenomenon a little weak, join the club. Maybe it's the 23rd century equivalent of 'freaking out.' Anyway, it's not a good thing, and the Enterprise tracks the source of the trouble to a man on a desolate planet and his small spacecraft there on the surface. The man, Lazarus, is not much help in explaining things either, babbling on and on, sometimes hysterically, about how he has to stop somebody and how Kirk and crew must help him. About a half-dozen times during the episode (seems like more) we are treated to a spinning visual effect that settles on a murky, foggy corridor of sorts where two figures are seen locked in a fierce struggle. Also, Lazarus has a bad habit of falling off cliffs. McCoy treats him for a head injury, and even though he is clearly unbalanced and dangerous, turns him loose to wander the ship and steal a couple of dilithium crystals. When Kirk finds out, naturally being a bit perturbed, he asks McCoy where Lazarus went. McCoy shrugs and says, \"Oh I don't know, Jim. It's a big ship.\" Just totally blows Kirk off. Thank YOU, Dr. McCoy. Anyway, the episode meanders along, and between the spinning corridor scenes and Lazarus falling off a cliff here and there, we finally get to the heart of the matter. A parallel anti-matter universe threatens to collide with our own, destroying everything everywhere. Lazarus has a double in the other universe, a madman, and the only hope is to trap Lazarus and his mad double in the corridor for all eternity. Which they manage to do.

A while back, I heard some folks on TV referring to Yogi Bear as a \"classic\" cartoon and was absolutely shocked! Imagine,...a terrible cartoon with abysmal production values is now seen by some as a classic?!?! No way,...that is, unless classic means \"heaping pile of crap\".<br /><br />Back in the 1950s, Hanna-Barbera productions was a good thing. They were responsible for some wonderful Tom and Jerry shorts and they were well-respected. However, after getting fired by some idiots at MGM, they couldn't afford to direct cartoons with high production values. The number of frames used per second and the backgrounds for the animations in their new non-MGM toons were strictly bargain basement. And, in addition to low production values, they simply were unfunny and meant to appeal only to very young kids. And, by the 1960s, lousy quality cartoons were now the norm, so Yogi Bear was a pretty successful cartoon--along with other totally uninteresting characters as Quickdraw McGraw and Huckleberry Hound.<br /><br />So my final verdict is that they are crappy and helped usher in a 20-25 year period of horrible animation. Thanks to newer higher quality animation from Nickelodeon and others, hopefully we can forget this crap and realize that older isn't always better. Don't waste your time with these cartoons.", "sentiment": 0}

Man loves Gorillas, Gorillas get killed, man goes berserk (this is the big secret he's keeping mute over in the nuthouse?) Hopkins wades through the dreadful script as well as possible, but Gooding as usual hams it up to the max all movie long with his favorite screwed-up-Popeye-indignant face. A couple of choice scenes to demonstrate the cheeziness of this movie -- First, the scene in which Gooding gets all the inmates to tear up their playing cards while the inspirational music swells and you half-expect the cast to start the slow-unison clap from those awful highschool sports movies. Second, when Gooding gets out of his car in the end after quitting the asylum, he climbs out of the car and with more sappy music swelling does the Tim Robbins Shawshank-escape Jesus pose in the driving rain... unbelievable syrupy tripe.

Its past, all the different hands that have gone into shaping it, the work of the individual that creates that music at that moment. Music is the most delicate of the arts, for once created, it can never be re-created identically. And each moment is fleeing, dynamic, related to the moment before and the moment that follows. <br /><br />This movie follows the path of a violin, as it exchanges hands over centuries, touches lives, brings passion and pain. The theme of the movie, first hummed by the violin-maker's wife, becomes the voice of the violin, linking the human soul with that of the violin. I wouldn't go so far as to say that her soul inhabited the violin, as other reviews here have. However, I think the movie tries to show how everything that has occured in the life of this violin has affected and shaped it, made it into the perfect musical instrument it is. <br /><br />I was especially impressed by the performance of the little boy in vienna. He is actually playing the violin- amazing!!! And the soundtrack, of course, is incredible. Joshua Bell is God. <br /><br />Above all, this movie is about passion. Feelings are not just intangible wisps of nothingness that vanish as soon as they are created. They remain in the vessels that create them, and in the vessels that are affected by them. In this case, all the passion that surrounded this violin became a part of it. When one person played it, the music brought back the memories of all those who had played it before. <br /><br />The story is slower than most movies today, yes. But why let that dissuade you? Why go see a movie if you aren't willing to let it take you in, absorb you, and free you from the time contraints of everyday life? The movie is made to be watched, not as an accompaniment to popcorn. Let the story be spun around you, and take things in as they come. Trust in the storyteller to unfold the events fully and satisfactorily. You have all the time in the world to watch this movie. <br /><br />Finally, let the music itself envelop you. Feel the sweep of the phrases and the rich fullness in the violin's voice. Enjoy the lopsided, fun, gypsy's theme (my personal favorite), the firey passion of pope' theme, the frenzied desperateness that comes with the little boy in vienna. Take in the despair that was the cultural revolution in China, where anna's theme, full of longing and sadness, comes to its prime. <br /><br />Anna knows she is going to die, hence her melancholy humming.

They encounter many traps and dangers along the way (including a derelict spacecraft and a mysterious nebula) but the greatest conflict seems to be psychological: namely, the titanic ambition of a 15-year, trans-galactic voyage pitted against the fragility of the human mind and the relative insignificance of human lives.<br /><br />The interior sets are lavish -- certainly on a par with \"Forbidden Planet\" and perhaps even \"2001\". The level of detail in the spaceship interiors is admirable, and the same can be said for the smartly designed spacesuits.<br /><br />\"Ikarie XB 1\" stumbles badly, though, when it comes to the exterior effects work. The spacecraft models are too small to provide much detail, and seem to be propelled through space by dark-colored string.

Ross gets plenty of opportunities to sing and though she really doesn't sound anything like Holliday did, she does capture the spirit of this tragic songbird.

Yeah. So obviously this little film caught my interest, way back when Stop and Shop (as you can tell I'm a New Englandah), had movie rentals! Not to mention the rarest ones such as this! Peter No Tail is a unique story of a family who want to adopt a cat. The local farmhand's cat had just given birth to a litter of kittens, and he was selling them. But alas, nobody would adopt Peter, the kitten who was, uh, lacking in the tail department. Finally, a family take him in, give him a cute little cap to wear and green bow-tie and everything! It's a cute and offbeat look at how Peter tries to win the heart of the cat community, despite their scoffing at him and his tail lackage (is that a word?). He competes with a nasty cat named Max, and his sidekicks, Bill and Bull, in a sort of athletic decathlon and to win the heart of a lovely feline female. It's a tad bit dated, but considering the fact that it's a 25 year old flick, it's still wonderful today and I still own a copy...somewhere.", "sentiment": 0}

Destiny just practically copied everything from Seed, except doing them backwards, rather than the ZAFT steals EA's mobile suits at the beginning of the season, this time is the opposite...and ZAFT have shitty mobile suits this season, the only fights that are worth seeing is when Kira kicks ass with Gundam Freedom, and later on both Kira and Athrun kick ass with their Infinite Justice and Strike Freedom. Probably the only thing worth seeing. The new characters are soooo annoying, if u ppl thought Yzak was bad, then man he is a cool character, and him and Dearka should have had a bigger role in this season. Shin is just unacceptable, a BRAT!!!<br /><br />OK, i might sound like a complete ass for dissing this so much, but if ur looking for a good plot then don't bother with this season, if u end it at Seed, then it makes hell of a better ending than continuing like this.<br /><br />I personally loved Gundam Seed, although I was cheering for Fllay to die lol. but Destiny is just utterly disappointing.", "sentiment": 0}

I didn't expect so much from it and I was really surprised by that movie, which is totally different from what we usually in american cinema. Here we are with the story of these men, Chad and Howard who have to spend 6 weeks far from their home sent there by their \"firm\". They decide to have a revenge on women and will both seduce one, they will expect her to fall in love with one of them and they will give her up. We spend our time asking why they really decide to do that, do they really want to hurt someone like that for such reasons ? we try to find a concrete reason to their evilness, but we can't, we want to leave our seat because that's too disturbing but the questions we're asking ourselves can't let us leave it. The conclusion is very hard, but we've got there a reflection about power in general, not only about men and women,about those who have power (like Chad and Howard) and those who don't have the sanme power (Christine and Kif). we're also amazed to see this kind of men, the white collars, be shown that way while they usually are shown as example for the american dream of the individualism and economical liberalism. I told many people to watch it, they all liked it, I even watched it with a feminist, who loved it, but it provides you a big big headache. That's a movie which dares to show things.

{"id": 7612, "text": "Not all of the plays by Noel Coward have been put on the screen. PRIVATE LIVES was (Robert Montgomery and Norma Shearer). So was BLYTHE SPIRIT (Rex Harrison and Margaret Rutherford). So was CAVALCADE (which actually won the best picture award in 1933 - but did it really deserve it?). HAY FEVER has not popped up, nor PERIOD PIECE, nor SOUTH SEA BUBBLE. And DESIGN FOR LIVING has popped up (the same year CAVALCADE did), but in a bowdlerized version. Still Ernst Lubitsch's DESIGN FOR LIVING was a highly amusing comedy, even if part of the \"design for living\" was seriously missing.<br /><br />Tom (Fredric March) is a writer - a dramatist. His closest friend is George (Gary Cooper) an artist. On a train trip they share a compartment with Gilda (Miriam Hopkins), also an artist - but one who works for an advertising firm run by Max Plunkett (Edward Everett Horton). Both young men are seriously smitten with her, and she fully appreciates them. So they have a dilemma - who would she rather be with. She solves it by making an agreement to live with them as their \"muse - den mother\". In short she will be keeping them from turning out shoddy work - telling them what she finds is \"ROTTEN!!\" (Hopkins' pronunciation of that word is quite memorable). She will also continue working for Max. All three find this an agreeable idea, although Max does not. He may be a good businessman himself, but he finds Gilda quite a sexual turn-on too. So Max hates Tom and George.<br /><br />This odd menage-a-trois cannot work. The three partners are all good looking, and their hormones are active. Soon Gilda runs off with George, leaving a teary note for Tom. He follows, and spends a highly pleasant afternoon with Gilda, until George returns and has a fit. Then she decides to save their friendship by leaving - and accepting Max's businesslike proposal of marriage. Tom and George go on a long foreign trip, missing Gilda's wedding. Max and Gilda go to a four star hotel, enter the bridal sweet, and shortly afterward Max realizes that he is missing the honey moon!<br /><br />Still, Max can always hope. Gilda is plenty willing to be a good sport and help build up his business. When entertaining important clients like Mr. and Mrs. Egelbauer (the cement king), Gilda will willingly (if haltingly) lead the stuffy guests in a pleasant parlor game of \"Twenty - Questions\" (Hopkins reluctant sounding, \"Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?\" at the start is heart-breaking). But Tom and George return to free her spirit from durance vile. And Max...he is reminded that the Egelbauers of the world never cared for Gilda, so when he announces his divorce it will double or triple his business.<br /><br />When Noel Coward wrote DESIGN FOR LIVING, in 1930-31, he did plan for it to be performed with his friends Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontane. Lunt and Fontane were the leading \"married couple\" stars of the American theater at that time. People in the know realized that Lunt was gay and (rumor had it) Fontane was a lesbian, but the marriage worked because of mutual artistic respect and partnership (oddly enough not so much in film - only one movie, THE GUARDSMAN - but in stage work and later television). With this in mind, Coward actually constructed the menage-a-trois of the play to be two bi-sexual men and the woman they jointly love. The bi-sexuality of Tom and George is not really developed in this film (Lubitsch would not have minded putting it in, but the powers that were at Paramount would have had fits). If you think of the central situation, though, and Gilda's reluctance to split the two \"boys\" there is a trace of Coward's original idea there.<br /><br />The odd man out here is Max. It's ironic that Horton played Max, for in real life he was gay (Cooper was notorious, despite his marriage, for affairs with Marlene Dietrch, Patricia Neal, and several other women; although March had a long marriage to Florence Eldritch, he had a reputation as being a real \"letch\"). Horton's Max is quite sympathetic, despite his self-importance and no-nonsense view of things. He does have one of the most memorable moments in \"Lubitsch Touch\" cinema, when we see him and Hopkins go into the bed chamber on their wedding night. There is a long pause to represent a sizable passage of time. Then a disgruntled Max leaves the bed-room (obviously he has not gotten anything), spots a floral gift from \"the boys\", and kicks it viciously! <br /><br />Max does one other thing that I find endearing - unintentionally he gives a good line of dialog (\"Immorality may be fun, but....\") to Tom, who sees what a good line of dialog it is. Subsequently, while attending Tom's smash comedy, Max is amazed to hear the line sprouted by a pompous figure on stage. More reason to hate Tom there!", "sentiment": 0}

How did this dope get through law school, let alone get a job with the LA DA's office? And nevermind his being courted by that high-powered law firm! That was completely unrealistic for a character like his with a annoyingly detached view of just about everything.

Although I heard that there were many differences between the real life Rocky Dennis and his movie counterpart and in spite of melodrama and some cloying touchy feely cuteness , \"Mask\" often feels like real life , which can be both comforting and disturbing, especially considering that real people can and did have the disease presented in the movie (with frighteningly realistic makeup). Nevertheless, the movie really does go the extra mile. Cher and Eric Stoltz give the impression that they actually BECAME the characters. I almost disbelieved it was them although I saw other movies of theirs. The characters were three dimensional and the script was simply great, offsetting the heaviness of its subject matter with a surprisingly effective sense of humor. Rocky´s problems, social, physical and otherwise, were presented in a well balanced context that never wallowed in the problems but did not trivialize them either. In the end, it delivered the message that your problems are only as big as you make them as long as you never give up in pursuing your goals. To be sure, Laura Dern here is as mousy and awkward as in most of her other movies and Sam Elliot is mostly just there to look cool but all in all, this movie deserves 9 stars out of 10.

While only a starting point, it's the beginning of understanding that any of us is capable of criminal acts.

How do you live with it 6 months down the road, 6 years, 15 years? How does your perception of life and self change as you fill the hours to pass one more day, then another?<br /><br />This was a fascinating, poignant, moving film. The biggest drawback was the camera's/editor's love affair with Glenn Close. I agree with other reviewers that the scenes with the actresses doing beginning read-throughs were somewhat distracting, but the incessant focus on Close was downright irritating. <br /><br />I also thought the contrast between the inmates' readings and the actresses' readings of the same words was highly intriguing. Most of the inmates are monotone, like most people are when reading. The actresses seem almost over the top in comparison, but I'll bet it made a powerhouse performance when experienced live.

Like the thoughtful horror cinema of George Romero, where deeper human issues boil under a more obvious horror surface, \"Ginger Snaps\" used lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty and its impact on teenage relationships; \"Unleashed\" uses it as a metaphor for addiction, with Brigitte Fitzgerald (Emily Perkins--\"It\"), sister of the ill-fated Ginger (Katharine Isabelle), injecting herself with wolfbane to curb her increasingly wolf-like tendencies. While in a rehab clinic for troubled teens, Brigitte forges a relationship with Ghost (Tatiana Maslany), a precocious girl whose seeming innocence unravels her secret. The new writing/directing team of Megan Martin and Brett Sullivan pick up where the previous film left off, skillfully bridging the two with a bare minimum of rehashed exposition, and the end result is extremely satisfying (though the machinations of \"Unleashed\"'s final third made me wish the script had tied some thematic/character arcs together better). Perkins, who is becoming a real horror ingénue, plays Brigitte with sympathy and sarcastic bite, and her relationship with Maslany comes close to matching the sense of sisterly love that provided the endearing backbone of the original \"Ginger Snaps.\" \"Unleashed\" is the rare sequel that does its parent proud.", "sentiment": 0}

It's at times mythical, poignant, and yet disturbingly absurd.<br /><br />Not that it needs Newsom's music to make it so. The animation alone is like suffering a bad acid trip. But when things like this come together so well and involve so many different styles and talents, it stands out as a beacon for deranged creativity, the chance that one person's unique taste will find other muses to create new expression.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 2031, "text": "So Close is THE movie that hooked me onto foreign cinema. Like many Americans I was ignorant to everything except horribly dubbed martial arts films from the 1970s. I visited my video store one day and noticed So Close in the Action section, immediately assuming that it would be a good film to laugh at. Subsequent to watching this film, however, I was confused. Had I just inadvertently watched an EXCELLENT film? Yes, I had! My criteria for excellence is quite simply entertainment value, regardless of the genre (i.e., drama, horror, action, romance, etc.). And yes, there are serious dramas that are quite frankly NOT entertaining, and therefore NOT good movies, regardless of how many awards the \"official critics\" want to give them. In like manner, there are actioners that are VERY entertaining, and therefore VERY good movies, regardless of how negatively the \"official critics\" want to rate them. Keeping this in mind, So Close is simply BURSTING with entertainment value.<br /><br />First of all, the action sequences are very well done, and are highlighted by the final infiltration of a corporate high-rise, which ends with an absolutely CLASSIC three-way swordfight. The choreography (both gunplay and swordplay) is phenomenal, and puts the vast majority of actioners to shame. It is admitted that this film focuses more on finesse than the power and brutality of Hong Kong films released in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is actually a good thing when one considers the originality of the movements and the length of the scenes themselves, which greatly exceed most of the action sequences in previous (and subsequently released) movies. The stylish protagonists use a treasure chest of items  satellite imagery, high-frequency earrings, guns, wall-piercing high heels, miniature grappling hooks, swords, decoy programs, bamboo sticks, etc.  in a wide variety of ways to eliminate the antagonists. The sheer diversity that is showcased in this film is enough to overpower three typical action films put together. Finally, it is a delight to experience action sequences where the characters actually DO something, instead of making theatre poses and shooting little glowing balls at each other (as in Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero). It is also a delight to see carefully choreographed movements, instead of slide-shows with chaotic camera-work that makes the scenes completely impossible to follow (as in Ashes of Time).<br /><br />One important point to be made is that this film contributes characters that are LOVABLE. Regardless of who is present on screen (Zhao, Karen, Shu, or Yasuaki), it is an enjoyable experience. This adds significant entertainment value for scenes shown in-between fights, and therefore enables So Close to avoid the incessant boredom that most actioners inflict upon their viewers.<br /><br />In fact, So Close BLOWS AWAY virtually every other Chinese action movie from the apparent \"Golden Age\" era of the 1980s and 1990s (with the exception of a limited few, which include Hard Boiled, Fist of Legend, and She Shoots Straight). I almost feel sorry for anyone who is willing to cite movies like Yes Madam, Royal Warriors, In the Line of Duty 3, Women on the Run, Naked Killer, or The Big Heat  none of which can hold a candle to So Close (in terms of action, characters, or sheer entertainment value).<br /><br />Was this film so groundbreaking that it single-handedly opened the flood gates to an entirely new realm of cinema for me to explore? Is So Close the primary reason that I have thusfar viewed over 900 Chinese, Japanese, and Korean movies over the few years and have added over 300 more in my online rental queue? Yes, it was!

{"id": 2872, "text": "My first exposure to the world of Lenny Bruce was the Broadway show, Lenny. The film is (loosely) based on the play, which rather faithfully followed the life of Lenny Bruce (more or less) and told his story using entirely his own words. In the stage version, Lenny was played by Cliff Gorman, whose best known role was that of the wildly effeminate character Emory in both the film and original stage productions of Mart Crowley's play the Boys in the Band. At the time, I ran out and purchased everything I could find on Lenny Bruce, because Cliff Gorman was that funny. I laughed so hard in the theatre, I thought I'd die, and had trouble deciding what was more important, Lenny Bruce's status as one of the funniest comedians around, or the amazing social commentary that was contained in his routines. At the time, I remember thinking that Lenny Bruce was more of a philosopher or even a potential cult religious leader than a comedian. He had a knack of exposing hypocrisy, be it in politics, organized religion, race relations or whatever. I was convinced, at the tender age of 18, that Lenny Bruce had the keys, if not the answers, to all of the world's problems.<br /><br />I went out and purchased the cast album of the Broadway show, which consisted of a 2 LP recording of a complete live performance of the play. I spent hours comparing Cliff Gorman to the real Lenny Bruce, and each time I listened to either, I memorized one of Lenny's hysterically funny bits. When I listened to records of the real Lenny Bruce, I marveled at how perfectly Cliff Gorman had reproduced his persona. The rapid-fire delivery, the inflection, even the tonal quality of his voice and the exact pauses in his speech were there. It was like Lenny Bruce had been reincarnated as Cliff Gorman. I had trouble deciding if this was great acting or just a good impersonation, and in the end decided it didn't matter, for the material in Lenny seemed to capture the real Lenny Bruce. That was good enough for me.<br /><br />When the film was announced, and I'd heard that Dustin Hoffman had been chosen to play Lenny, I was thrilled. As a fan of Mr. Hoffman, I was sure he could do great justice to both the man and the material. By the time the picture was completed, I had learned almost as much about Lenny Bruce's life as I ever would, and was familiar with probably 80% of his most famous routines. The Masked Man, Christ and Moses, Las Vegas Tits and Ass, Airplane Glue, Ike and Nixon, Jackie Kennedy  I knew a lot of these by heart. Some of them I memorized cold, and found that when people mentioned his name at parties or family gatherings, and someone invariably asked who he was, rather than explain his life or what he died of, all I had to do was recite one of his bits. I never had a single person who was new to his material that didn't pronounce him awesome (as the kids say nowadays) on the spot.<br /><br />I don't remember what film I was watching (it was 31 years ago) when I first saw a trailer for the film, but as soon as I saw a clip of Dustin Hoffman as Lenny I knew something was wrong. I had a sinking feeling that I wasn't going to like the movie bio of what was now my favorite comedian, but I went to see it anyway, as soon as it opened, hoping my gut instinct was wrong. The cinematography was stunning. The direction was first rate. The story was fairly faithful to the life and spirit of Lenny Bruce, and Dustin Hoffman did as good an acting job as I'd ever seen. All of the bits were there, and so was a fairly faithful rendering of his professional life. So what was the problem? The problem was simply that Dustin wasn't funny. Those were Lenny Bruce's words and Lenny Bruce's life, but the jokes fell flat. I came to the conclusion that no matter how skilled he is as an actor, Dustin Hoffman is no comedian. He certainly was no Lenny Bruce. Where was the lightning timing I was used to from the Cliff Gorman and Lenny Bruce recordings? Mr. Hoffman seemed very unsure of his material, and delivered all the routines at what seemed like half-speed. It was almost like he was a 45 RPM record being played at 33 1/3. I wanted to reach into his mouth and pull the words out, and shout at the screen, \"You've got it all wrong! This is too somber and too slow and toounfunny to be Lenny Bruce\". Worse, Mr. Hoffman had the annoying habit (which Lenny never did) of laughing at his own jokes. Not loud guffaws mind you, just chuckles. Constant chuckles, almost to himself, which left me with the impression that he thought that he was the only one who got the material.<br /><br />I bought the VHS when it came out several years later and watched it faithfully, hoping that as an older and wiser person, maybe I would find things in Mr. Hoffman's performance that I missed in 1974. I wanted it to click. No such luck. I then dutifully purchased the DVD, as I have always purchased \"new\" Lenny Bruce recording or, lately videos, never tiring of his delivery or his message. Again, I hoped that time had been kind to the portrayal I had so looked forward to in 1974. But I screened it recently, and the film still leaves me cold, despite the best of intentions, the flawless direction and the great production values. Icon, philosopher, cult leader or genius, if nothing else, Lenny Bruce was funny. And Dustin Hoffman was not.", "sentiment": 0}

There is a fairly decent silent version starring Ramon Navarro and a flashier 1950's version with Stewart Granger but this one leads the pack as the most entertaining and the best directed. Dashing Douglas Fairbanks Jr. always in the shadow of his famous father gives the role of Rupert all he's got and that's a lot. He steals every scene he's in, even from the likes of Ronald Coleman and Raymond Massey. He gives treachery and deceit not to mention opportunism new meanings in his double dealings. Few today have even heard of Junior, though most movie buffs have heard of his father silent star Douglas Fairbanks and step mother for a time Mary Pickford. Senior divorced Junior's mother to marry Pickford. Junior gave other outstanding performances on the big screen especially in \"Gunga Din\" in 1939 opposite Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen. He went on to have a popular television show in the early days of that medium \"Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents.\" He gradually retired from films. Sadly when he passed away in the year 2000 very few knew who he was. <br /><br />Ronald Coleman gets to play two parts Maj. Rudolf Rassendyll and King Rudolf V, two lookalike cousins from a family indiscretion several generations back. He does so admirably. Though Madeleine Carroll as Princess Flavia who loves one cousin but is tied to the other out of duty and patriotism is a hard act to follow as always, Mary Astor gives her a good run for the money as Black Michael's (Raymond Massey)lady love. The two ladies counterbalance each other well as stand by your man women but for different reasons. The always underrated and under-appreciated actor Raymond Massey makes the character of Michael come alive with jealousy and vainglory but with true love in his heart for his Antoinette. The grand old man of early cinema C. Aubrey Smith is around to make sure all is done correctly according to pomp and circumstance. David Niven in an early screen role gives his portrayal of Capt. Fritz Von Tarlenheim the easy touch, almost tongue in cheek at times, which lightens the heavy load for the viewers. He is a good counterbalance for the dour C. Aubrey Smith. Silent screen veteran actor Montagu Love is present to show them all how it's done. What a troupe of Thespians to savor!<br /><br />John Cromwell directs with flair and makes the film move at a fast pace especially near the end. The action sequence when the castle is stormed following the lowering of the draw bridge is intense. The rapier fight between Coleman and Fairbanks is still exciting to watch.

When the torturers were killed in the jail (by zeki demirkubuz..etc), some people in the theater applauded as a reaction of convenience.

That's a shame because Almost An Angel is a very engaging comedy, the sort of picture that stands up like a Capraesque piece for the 90s. It's the sort of fable that cheers one up when the blues draw in and then turn into a blackly dark cloud, yes it be true, old craggy faced Paul Hogan has the gift of comedy. Yes the doses of sentiment are at times like a treacle itch to be scratched, but is that a bad thing?, watching a street wise criminal turning his less than honourable skills into a thing of goodness?.<br /><br />The film has many visual gags to go with the ream of religious ones that flow within the piece, be it Hogan attempting to fly or a quiet word about Elvis, Almost An Angel delights if one accepts the nature of the beast.

{"id": 3031, "text": "This is a harmless though brainless film. However, due to the many logical errors in the film, I can't recommend it as anything other than a time-passer--and only if you can manage to turn off your brain for a while while you watch. Otherwise, what happens in the last portion of the film might make you either throw something at the TV or curse yourself for investing this much time in a dopey film. Now I know that there are many Loretta Young and probably more Tyrone Power fans out there and I don't mean to offend them. Heck, I usually love these actors, too, but I also can't lie and say it's one of their better films.<br /><br />The film starts off well enough and I really liked the first half. Adolph Menjou is the co-owner of this restaurant but he needs to pay off a \"loan\" FAST or lost his restaurant. So, on a lark, he gambles and actually earns enough to pay off the money he lent himself (illegally) and save his butt. However, it turns out that the young guy (Tyrone Power) who he won the money from is broke. Instead of sending Power to jail for writing a bad check to cover his losses, Menjou decides to force Power into becoming his slave. And, as his slave, he has Power pose as a Russian prince so they can both bilk a rich young lady (Young) of the money to save the restaurant. So far so good.<br /><br />Now the fact that Power didn't do so well with impersonating a Russian wasn't a problem--after all, he wasn't supposed to be perfect and she was supposed to eventually figure out that he was a phony. However, and here's where the film gets dumb, although she knows he's a criminal, she falls in love with him(????) and insists she must marry him. Now we could assume that either Miss Young's character is schizophrenic or suffered a massive brain injury, but when her aunt agrees with her and they work hard to get Power (even after he's robbed them), this strains common sense way beyond the breaking point. She barely knew the guy and most of what she knew about him was terrible---yet she insisted on marrying him and having everyone live happily ever after. And on top of this, Ms. Young yells and bellows and over-emotes like mad when she argues with her father about this. Oh, brother, give me a barf bag!! <br /><br />The only reason I even gave the film a score this high is that despite being brainless, the film had some nice moments and the actors seemed to try hard with material that was simply beneath them. Also, the film deserves no better than a 4 because some excellent dance scenes with Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson were in the film but they were cut before it was released!! Fortunately, they are included on the new DVD version of this film. You'll find the first one simply brilliant--and probably better than anything Fred Astaire ever did.

The agency is looking for the criminal mastermind, who has a t-shaped scar on the right side of his face. Yes, there is an actual plot to this, but it proceeds at such a limp pace, I feel they should have concentrated more on meaningless sex scenes. In fact, when the two main characters get down and do it, the scene cuts just as they start, a baffling methodology of the director and editor for a supposed sex spoof. The filmmakers are more intent on letting the movie camera linger on those huge breasts, whether the character is speaking on the phone or whatever. The director also likes to concentrate shots on arbitrary objects in the scene, or a little dog on the grass, for no reason. This could be instructional for film students on how not to shoot and edit a film.<br /><br />This is, of course, a continuing attempt to capitalize on the James Bond-type spy thriller, going all the way back to such female Bonds as \"Modesty Blaise\" and the similarly no-budget \"Girl From S.I.N.\" Agent 73, as played by Chesty Morgan, does assassinate various characters, but she acts out the killings in such a lifeless manner, beyond just being casual, you get not so much as a chill as just a sense that the actress can't act worth a damn. She previously used her breasts in \"Deadly Weapons,\" actually smothering people to death; here, it's more standard, like garroting someone with a cord, though there's one scene involving ice cubes which is different, if still dull. In the end - and here is the spoiler - she finds out who the master villain is and, with the usual lack of emotion, shoots him as he asks her to marry him; my only thought was, why would this guy want to marry this freakish zombie-lady?

Film-making in Mexico hasn't changed a bit as far as content from the drug dealer and prostitute movies of the eighties, even though is a little bit more polished (to the point of being pretentious and exclusive). In this movie, as in most recent Mexican filmography, crime (kidnapping in this case) is the only choice for the main male character to get ahead, and the main female character is, yet again, a prostitute. <br /><br />This movie abuses the grotesque element, and I think it's degrading for the main characters in the cast. The main actors must have been in much need of money to go through what they did, taking into consideration that he used non actors, mostly to accentuate, exaggerate and exhibit their physical shortcomings rather than to create and develop characters. You can see how much the director, probably a high class \"junior\" (because nobody finances his own debut with 50K out of his own pocket), despises and makes fun very sarcastically of the lower classes. <br /><br />As for the rest of the movie, it's deliberately slow and aimless. Whatever meaning a certain shot could have had is diluted by its lack of movement, lenght and ambiguity. Besides, there are a lot of scenes that stop the rhythm and don't contribute to the development of a story a bit.

First, Sheriff Bingham Hunt (Steve Adams of \"The Bone Collector') mortally wounds the driver of the getaway, and the vehicle careens out of control and smashes into Hunt's wife Tracy (Claudia Bess of \"Strip Search\") as she is trying to give him his personal radio. Rudy gets off with what appears to be a flesh wound and races out of town. No sooner has he left the city limits than another sheriff's deputy blue-lights him. When the deputy approaches the car, Rudy jumps out and guns him down, then ices his partner, and commandeers the sheriff's cruiser. The grief-stricken Hunt sets out to capture and kill Rudy, but Rudy outsmarts him and hijacks Jed and his family while the protagonist is making small repairs to his 1979 motor home. Rudy gets tire of Jed's sass, shoots him, and leaves him for dead on the roadside. Earlier, after Rudy shot the sheriff's deputy, he not only stole his cruiser but also his jacket. Now, Rudy leaves the sheriff's jacket with Jed and takes off with Jed's family as his hostage. Rudy is bound and determined to reach his rendezvous point with the plane so he can get out of the country. As it turns out, when Rudy shot Jed, Rudy's bullet lodged in Jed's cell phone and Jed resolves to catch up to Rudy. The problem is that Jed doesn't know that Sheriff Hunt is determined to kill Rudy. Moreover, when Jed tries to flag Hunt down, the sheriff sees the jacket taken off his murdered deputy and shoots first before he can confirm Jed's story. Director Eric Weston juxtaposes scenes of the sheriff's manhunt, Jed's efforts to rescue his family, and Rudy's desperate efforts to get away with the loot. Unfortunately, juxtaposing these three characters and their objectives generates no suspense. The cliff-hanger conclusion doesn't add much to this paint-by-the-number nonsense. Clearly, Madison needed a paycheck. In fact, we learn nothing about Madison's character because the scenarists provide him with no backstory. As this generation's Robert Mitchum, Madison has great presence but he makes no impression on this second-rate actioneer. Martial arts expert Jeff Wincott adopts a different look, but his vicious killer is a nit-wit. Michelle Scarabelli effectively plays one of Hunt's level-headed deputies who ensures that her hysteria-riddled sheriff doesn't kill the wrong man. \"Pressure Point\" lacks pressure from start to finish and makes no point other than to burn time.", "sentiment": 0}

The movie documents his travels in learning to play the piano all over again and his life along this path. With his father and colleagues pushing him away from the piano, he gathers more steam.

{"id": 27283, "text": "I won't add to the many superlatives ascribed to this wonderful series, well-deserved though they are. But I would like to point out a few vital details that help explain just why it is so wonderful.<br /><br />(1) Much has been said about Siân Phillips' intense projection of evil, but just how does she do it? If you watch carefully, you'll see she never blinks in her close-up takes, some of which are very long. This gives her a snakelike appearance, which enhances her voice and cold beauty in imparting such an air of menace to everything she says.<br /><br />(2) Much has also been said about the lack of expensive sets, location shots, or special effects. But the point is that this series is successful because of these apparent deficiencies and not despite them. So much modern cinema and TV is swamped by expensive irrelevances to the detriment of the basics -- writing, acting, and timing. 'I Claudius' shows just how important these things are, and how unimportant those expensive special effects can be.<br /><br />(3) I had the good fortune to read both books before the series was made, and then to watch it with a critical eye. It was satisfying to see such an expert adaptation, but especially so to see how the central point of the story has not been lost: the inability of any ruler, however powerful, to control what happens at the end of the long chain of command that inevitably forms. I found this a message of lifelong importance in both politics and management, and it is rare indeed that such a remarkable piece of drama and entertainment is also so fundamentally educational.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 20793, "text": "Mike Myers can't seem to get enough of himself in The Love Guru. He's constantly giggling at his own jokes, and mugging for the camera as if he thinks his latest comedy creation is the funniest thing he's invented. I had a very different reaction. Pitka was born in America, and traveled to India to study under the cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudah (Ben Kingsley), who taught his students lessons by having them hit each other with urine-soaked mops. Pitka devotes his life and his teachings to helping other people out with their relationship troubles, and hopes his words of wisdom will become so popular, he'll wind up on Oprah.<br /><br />This is information we learn early on in the film (after Pitka serenades us with a Bollywood-style musical number of Dolly Parton's Nine to Five during the opening credits), and I pretty much knew right there that The Love Guru was going to be a very long 90 minutes. The movie makes a grave miscalculation with its lead character. Guru Pitka is not funny or likable. It's simply Myers talking in a funny accent, and coming up with as many alternate ways for saying \"penis\" as he can without losing the film's PG-13 rating. Pitka is not even a real character. Myers plays him more as an experiment, as if he's still testing the character out, and we the audience are the guinea pigs being subjected to the experiment. It's been widely reported that the reason why Myers hasn't done a live action film in five years is because he's been fine tuning his Guru Pitka at various comedy clubs until he felt he was ready. He was not ready, and he probably should have spent another five years if the end result is any indication.<br /><br />Pitka is approached by Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba), the owner of the struggling Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team. Her star player, Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco), hasn't been performing up to the best of his abilities ever since his wife, Prudence (Meagan Good), left him for the goalie on the rival team - a French player named Jacques \"Le Coq\" Grande (Justin Timberlake, embarrassing himself here) who is known for his over-sized \"manhood\" as much as he's known for his talent in the game. The character exists simply so that Myers and co-screenwriter Graham Gordy can have the characters say cock a lot more than humanly necessary. The Maple Leafs have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup, but not if Darren doesn't have his head in the game. The team's pint-sized coach (Verne Troyer) doubts that Pitka can turn the situation around, but the Guru is determined to help. He'll do this by finding a way to distract Darren from his problems (By forcing him to watch two elephants having sex, thereby taking his mind off of his problems with his wife. You figure it out.), and help him confront his over-bearing mother (Telma Hopkins), who has long cast a shadow over the star player.<br /><br />The Love Guru is not a comedy, it is a cry of desperation on behalf of Myers and everyone involved. Comedy is funniest when it seems to come naturally out of the material, but everything seems so forced and strained here. It's almost like if they can't think of something funny to do, they'll throw in elephants humping each other, or light a midget on fire. And if that doesn't work, they'll throw in another couple references to male genitalia. If there's a bigger cry of comic desperation than limp innuendo humor, then it has to be out of the blue musical numbers that are not funny in themselves, the movie just expects us to laugh at the fact that the characters are suddenly singing for no reason. You know, I think I'm going to have to take that last statement back. There's an even more desperate form of comedy, and that would have to be building an entire scene around the fact that Guru Pitka has a different kind of food stuck in his beard each time we see him, building up to a sight gag where his entire beard is cotton candy. This movie has so many scenes of just plain wrong-headed desperation, you'd almost think it was intentional.<br /><br />While Myers cackles and mugs his face with glee, pretending that he's having a great time, the rest of the cast kind of look like they wish they were somewhere else. Jessica Alba looks uncomfortable, and her scenes where she's supposed to be warming up to Pitka look more like she's hanging out with him out of pity more than anything else. It's not unusual in a comedy to have the supporting players stand in the background so the star can do his thing, but the cast here seem just as confused as I was as to what we were supposed to be watching Myers doing. <br /><br />There is not a single laugh or moment of inspiration in The Love Guru. It's just a sad, depressing slog through material that's not funny to start with, taken by actors who seem to know it's not funny. It's bad enough when a comedy can't generate any laughs, but it gets even worse when you start feeling sorry for everyone up on the screen. You want to ask them and their agents what they were thinking when they signed up. You want to remind Myers of just how funny he can be, and why this material and character don't suit him. But most of all, you want to be able to somehow turn back time to before you gave the ticket counter your money, walk back out the door, and figure out another way to spend 90 minutes.", "sentiment": 0}

In the second half, as the plot thickens and the parts of the puzzle begin to fit into a whole (i.e. as the main character starts to remember more and more of his past), there are also some fairly violent scenes, e.g. as a villain falls over a cliff or beautiful female lead Senta Berger swings a chainsaw. But, most importantly, even though the plot is a quite complicated net of strings that has to be lead together to the climax, the story remains plausible until the end, which isn't always the case in films of this genre.<br /><br />Apart from the convincing performance by Berger, Luc Merenda is also well casted in the title role, as is Umberto Orsini in the main supporting role. Look out for Giallo regular Anita Strindberg in a small but crucial role. The lush sound track is also very cool and adds to the viewing pleasure.

It is an original with a memorable ending that should not be spoiled, but it will almost definitely have people talking.<br /><br />In my mind, director Alex Proyas deserves a lot of the credit for the fact that the film is brave, and does not try to replicate a typical Hollywood blueprint.

The plot isn't much to speak of, with many of the revelations spoken by Verdegast. In fact, it's such an economical, light-on-story little movie, directed capably by B-movie veteran Edgar G. Ulmer, that it flies by and is over in just over an hour.<br /><br />It's quite a departure from the Gothic nightmares that were a number of the classic Universal chillers.

I stopped watching it because Tuesday nights became bad for me, but later on in the season I saw the episode when Bauer and Palmer finally met. From then on I finished out the season and was amazed. I bought the first season DVD over the summer and watched it all. After I finished, I could hardly wait for the next season. The first half of the season was solid, but then the second half got predictable. Nonetheless, I was still on the edge of my seat and by the end of the year I was left wanting more. Even though the fourth season was the worst, I was and remain convinced that a bad season of 24 is still better than a good season of any other show. Originally I was simply amazed by the constant cliffhangers that are drawn up week after week by the amazing writing crew. I'm now hooked on the soundtrack by Sean Callery and the performances by the characters, most notably Kiefer Sutherland as the great Jack Bauer. I was particularly impressed with his acting this season. Season 6 was the most emotionally traumatic season for Jack Bauer and Kiefer's acting was more than top notch! I don't understand how this last finale only has a 5.8. This finale was pure 24. The action sequences as well as the intensity of the acting by Kiefer in the last 12 minutes left me on the edge of my seat, more than ever! This show is the best on television because the writing is impeccable as well as the acting and the music. The character's performances among these other elements make this seem like more than a TV show or a movie for that matter. I'm impatiently waiting for the next season because this show is truly one in a million. No...one in 24 million!", "sentiment": 0}

Their facial expression has too many changes in one second it's not natural. And I'm hoping it's just me, I found Kiara very annoying, probably because of her sometimes-nasal voice (that always gives me a fake-cry impression). Besides, unlike Simba, she wasn't given the chance to mature. She was the same spoiled little girl from the beginning to end. It's a good thing they want to have a princess instead of a prince, but it's easy to tell the plot is still highly underneath Kovu. It's strange to talk about character chemistry in an animated movie, but I found Lion King II lack the kind of chemistry the first one had. Probably the director's fault.<br /><br />The plot did mature a lot, though. During a great length of the movie I thought Zira was to live. She's not really a villain, just some poor old thing stuck in the thoughts of revenge for too long. But I guess little kids won't understand it that way, so Kira dies at the end. Given a plot like this, it's pretty hard to screw up the characters due to lack of complicity, but they did.", "sentiment": 0}

There seemed to be lots of babbling about a 'book', which is mentioned many more times throughout the film. There was also lots of nonsense about satanism, with plenty of chanting and ranting thrown in. I ended up fast-forwarding through most scenes in the hope of something interesting happening. Eventually something interesting did happen, but as usual it was too little too late. In the climax we get some strange fish bowl thing called \"the devils rain\" which seems to contain tortured souls. I thought this was an interesting idea that had potential. The devils rain is smashed and all the souls (or devils, or whatever they're supposed to be) are released. They then melt away ala Street Trash in the church which then explodes. The explosion is quite cool - you don't see exploding churches in films every day. At the very end we also get a woman moaning in a tortured sort of way - I think the implication is that she's in hell, but I'm not sure. I should also mention the faces of the satanists/devils, they have white faces with blank eyes which looks rather disturbing. <br /><br />I can't really give The Devil's Rain more than three stars because it is mostly dull and confusing.

{"id": 49331, "text": "This lackluster Errol Flynn oater qualifies as one of his minor efforts. Clocking in at a sheer 73 minutes, \"Montana\" doesn't waste its time getting down to basics, but the narrative has its lapses. One character shows up and then is gone without an explanation. The performances are good and the Warner Brothers production values are bed-rock. Seasoned western writers such as James R. Webb and Borden Chase penned the screenplay, but they deliver little in the way of memorable dialogue and there are absolutely no surprises in this formulaic horse opera. Some of the situations, like our hero being duped into riding an unbreakable bronco, are old hat.<br /><br />Basically, Morgan Lane (Errol Flynn of \"The Sea Hawk\") plunges his flock of sheep into cattle country in 1879 and the cowboys refuse to tolerate these sheep-nanigans. No sooner has Lane and his flock entered cattle country than the cowboys descend on them at night with their guns blazing death. An unarmed, young Mexican shepherd becomes the first casualty with a bullet in the back. The following day Lane and company encounter Papa Otto Schultz (S.Z. Sakall of \"Casablanca\") who drives his peddler's wagon into their camp. Lane and Papa Otto become partners almost instantly and the two ride into Fort Humboldt to peddle his wares. Initially, Lane receives a chilly reception in the Little Big Horn Saloon where Slim Reeves (Ian MacDonald of \"High Noon\") goads him into a showdown after he labels Lane a sheep-man. Although he knows that it isn't any of his business, a bearded, leathery-looking Tecumseh Burke (Paul E. Burns of \"Son of Paleface\") pokes his nose into the confrontation. The older gunman offers Lane the use of his hardware since our hero doesn't pack a pistol. Tecumseh warns Lane that the trigger is tied back and he will have to fan the weapon. Slim shoves the holstered revolver and gun belt at Lane. Everybody clears out of the way so the two can shoot it out. Tecumseh starts the countdown to three, but the bushwhacking skunk that Slim is tries to shuck his six-shooter on two. Lane blows the revolver neatly out of his adversary's fist as easily as he might blow out a candle. The ruffian apologizes because he insists no sheepman could possibly wield a shooting iron with such dexterity.<br /><br />\"Montana\" features a romance between the principal players. Predictably, it doesn't take our hero long to meet, greet, and get sweet with cattle queen Maria Singleton (Alexis Smith of \"San Antonio\"), even though she is engaged to marry rancher Rod Ackroyd. Lane has Maria eating out of his hand after he wagers that he can ride a bronco that nobody else has managed to stay aboard for a full minute. Sneaky Reeves whittles away at the cinch and Lane barely missing staying in the leather long enough. Apparently, the colossal loss of money that Papa sacrificed not only drove him out of his partnership with Lane but also out of the movie. Papa vanishes and is never heard from again. Meanwhile, Maria decides to lease Lane some land to run his steers on since he didn't tame the bronco. At this point, things take a turn for the worse for our protagonist. Inexplicably, Lane's sheep dog Jeanne prances into town that same day that Lane steps outside the bank with Maria with the lease for the land. Reeves and his cohorts expose Lane as a sheepman when the mutt goes to him. Naturally, Maria is furious, but what she doesn't know is that her fiancée has been two-timing her with the lawman's girlfriend. Indeed, the lawman, Sheriff Jake Overby (Lane Chandler of \"Samson and Delilah\") doesn't know that he, too, is being two-timed.<br /><br />Meantime, the ornery cattlemen cannot shed their deep-seated prejudice toward the mutton-minded Lane. Lane argues that sheep and cattle can get along together. He has seen it in Mexico, but the cattlemen don't believe him. Gunslinging cattleman Rod Ackroyd (Douglas Kennedy of \"The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold\") leads the charge against Lane and his sheep and bites the dust. The showdown in front street at the end of the action looks like a mild imitation of \"Red River\" with our colorful heroine shooting the man that she loves. Flynn was looking a mite long in the tooth when he made this oater and the alcohol had robbed him of his spontaneity but not his charm. He looks a little more heavyset than usual. Smith doesn't look like she has changed since their last collaboration on \"San Antonio\" except that her outfits aren't as flamboyant. Mind you, she is a bit more hard-hearted and tough as a cattle queen who lost her father and brother in the war against the sheep herders.<br /><br />\"Montana\" doesn't rank in the same league with Flynn's more prestigious westerns like \"Dodge City,\" \"Virginia City,\" and \"They Died With Their Boots On.\" In fact, \"Montana\" rates as one of his least appealing westerns. At least the Technicolor makes this modest western look good. Strangely, the peddler that Sakall plays vanishes inexplicably from the action. If you want to see a genuinely entertaining cattle versus sheep western, watch director George Marshall's comedy western \"The Sheepman\" (1958) with Glenn Ford.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 18805, "text": "Although Cary Grant is justifiably remembered as a screen legend (indeed he was probably the most adept of any of his contemporaries at romantic comedy), it seems criminal that Irene Dunne is almost forgotten these days. This is the second and most lightweight of three very fruitful screen pairings they had during this period - the other two are the even more insane divorce farce, \"The Awful Truth\", from 1937 and 1941's child adoption tearjerker, \"Penny Serenade\". With her insinuating laugh and sophisticated but down-to-earth manner, she is a wonderful screwball heroine, even if she lacks the haughty glamour of Katharine Hepburn or the brazen beauty of Carole Lombard.<br /><br />Here Dunne plays Ellen Wagstaff Arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island. The problem is that her husband Nick has just gotten remarried to a high maintenance socialite named Bianca. Further complications ensue when it's disclosed that Ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic Adonis named Stephen Burkett, of course a bachelor. The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool. In 1940, the same year he made classics like \"The Philadelphia Story\" and \"His Girl Friday\", Grant is at the top of his game, and Dunne matches him every step of the way. It does seem a bit of a stretch to think that the principal characters would be celibate for seven long years, but such was 1930's Hollywood convention.<br /><br />Randolph Scott gamely plays the dumb-as-dirt Stephen, an ironic choice given the rumors of the actor's relationship with Grant. As Bianca, the glamorously venomous Gail Patrick - expert at such roles from classics like \"My Man Godfrey\" and \"Stage Door\" - knows her fate in the movie but doesn't really show her talons until the courtroom scene. In scene-stealing bits are Granville Bates as the frustrated judge and Donald MacBride as the confused hotel clerk. The only drawbacks are the overly precocious children played hammily by Scotty Beckett and Mary Lou Harrington. Directed with comic mastery by Leo McCarey, it's a frothy confection from a bygone era, and the far inferior 1963 Doris Day remake only proves how unmatchable Grant and Dunne are. The DVD has a surprisingly pristine print transfer, and extras include an unrelated comic short featuring humorist Robert Bentley and a condensed 1950 broadcast of the movie featuring Grant and Dunne.", "sentiment": 0}

Maybe it's because the screenplay is a bunch of unscrupulous and light-headed nonsense or maybe it's because you have a lot more sympathy for the characters here than it usually is the case in horror films, I don't know. Fact is that you will have a great time watching it. The Neon Maniacs are malevolent creatures (they look like hellraiser Cenobites only....goofier) who prowl at night in their San Franciscan territory, butcher teenagers and leave behind a funky green kind of mucus. The ravishing Nathalie (Sarelle - she'll later star alongside Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct) is the sole survivor of one of the maniacs' nightly attacks and now they're after her. As mentioned before, the premise of this film contains no logic at all. The existence of these Neon Maniacs is briefly linked to the downfall of humanity but, other than this, no background or origin is given. No problem, though, as there are tons of other absurd elements to enjoy. The costumes and make-up effects are great!

The story loses some of its impact around the hour, when the tempo is constantly interfered with lousy rock 'n roll concert sequences (an often-returning problem in 80's horror). The exaggeratedly abrupt ending disappoints too, especially since the obvious sequel never got made. Nevertheless, it remains a highly recommended splatter flick!

{"id": 20885, "text": "'Electric Shadows' tells a story about a girl named Ling Ling and her friend Mao Dabing against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution in China. The film starts with Dabing (Xia Yu), a teenager who loves movies, accidentally falling into a brick wall with his bicycle. The walls collapses, a girl picks up a brick and smashes Dabing on the head. Then the girl, who seems unable to speak, asks Dabing to feed her fish while she has to stay with the police. He agrees and in the girl's apartment he finds her diary, learning that she is indeed his old friend Ling Ling (Qi Zhongyang).<br /><br />While he is reading her story we see the images, starting with Ling Ling's mother, how she always wanted to be a famous actress or singer, how Ling Ling was born as an unwanted child, how her mother wanted to end her own life but due circumstances changes her mind. Ling Ling's mother becomes a caring mother who wants nothing but the best for her daughter. Dabing enters the story, at first a bully for Ling Ling but after a while they become best friends. In the meanwhile Ling Ling's mother spends a lot of time with Uncle Pan, the town's movie operator. This is of course where the kids find their love for the movies, and Ling Ling's mother finds the love for a new man.<br /><br />I should say nothing more about the story. We understand things will get complicated since Dabing and Ling Ling did not recognize each other when he was smacked with the brick. We also see that some terrible things must have happened to Ling Ling. All those things are for you to discover with this terrific film from first-time director Xiao Jiang. In a way this film is about loving movies, the way 'Cinema Paradiso' is that. The director told the audience that she was honored with this comparison, but it seems only right. 'Electric Shadows' is original in its own way, but shows a lot of older Chinese pictures, honoring them. The performances ask again for comparison with 'Cinema Paradiso'. The adults are good, especially Ling Ling's mother, but the child performers here are the best thing. The film shows them most of the time when they are around six years old. The way kids around that age say anything that comes to mind is perfectly portrayed here, with two effective kids for Ling Ling and Dabing. Much of the humor in the film comes from them and their moments together.<br /><br />Although the final moments of the film play in a conventional way the scenes work. Everything comes together, making 'Electric Shadows' a real finished picture, accessible for larger audiences than a lot of other Asian films. The film has its flaws. It shifts back and forth in time where it does not really have to, like the director just chose a couple of moments to do so. The same with the narration. Sometimes we hear Dabing and his life story, sometimes we hear him reading her diary, sometimes we hear Ling Ling herself like she is reading or writing her diary. Both things do not really matter, but show how hard it is to make the right choices, especially when you direct a film for the first time.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 4231, "text": "\"Die Hand Die Verletzt\" is one of my favorite X-Files episodes, and IMO it ranks right up there as one of the scariest of the series. Glen Morgan and James Wong came up with a great teleplay here - after a darkly humorous teaser, where we discover that the seemingly priggish, uptight-about-swear-words members of a PTC in New Hampshire are in fact a bunch of Satan-worshippers, the story begins as a worthy entry in the bad-things-happening-to-teenagers-in-the-woods genre which was especially popular in the first two seasons of the show. Things escalate rapidly from there, and Mulder and Scully wind up in the midst of occurrences which are particularly baffling even to them. The story has numerous twists and turns which disguise what's really going on for awhile, although clever editing does give us some hints. Kim Manners does an absolutely superb job as first-time director on the show - his weird camera angles and movements and spooky lighting really ratchet up the horror factor as the story progresses. \"Die Hand Die Verletzt\" is rife with unforgettable and terrifying visual images.<br /><br />IMO this episode also has some of the best guest-actor casting in the series. Heather McComb is riveting in her scene where she reveals apparently repressed memories of ritual abuse, and Dan Butler makes a big departure from Bulldog on Frasier to convincingly play a straight-laced suburban dad who's hiding some big secrets. Best of all is Susan Blommaert - as Mrs. Paddock, who turns out to be literally the substitute teacher from Hell, she conveys both innocent mentorly concern and murderously evil Satanic intent with equal skill. The second half of this episode is a genuinely frightening horror tale with no letup till the memorable ending, which leaves our heroes M & S still basically in the dark, only able to guess at what just happened.<br /><br />\"Die Hand Die Verletzt\" is just one of the reasons I like season 2 so much.

The succubus kills people, and nobody seems to notice for a while.<br /><br />Except for a few exterior shots of the house, I think the entire movie took place inside the main characters' house. The deaths were generally not terribly gory or interesting, except for a death by a power drill towards the end which was pretty well done. Apart from that, you have a bunch of actors who for the most part haven't acted in anything else. Despite some female nudity early on in the movie, and that all the characters are heterosexual, this movie does seem aimed at a gay male audience. There are lots of shots of guys with their shirts off, guys wearing nothing but white jockey shorts, guys completely baring their posteriors....<br /><br />I would definitely recommend people not waste their time with this movie. Exceptions might be made for people who can be very forgiving of low-budget horror movies' limitations, aren't looking for anything original, have a soft spot for the 1980s, or really like director David DeCoteau's work.<br /><br />Towards the end, there's a piece of paper on which is typed \"SUCCUBUS\" but part of the word is unreadable, so only \"SUC\" can be read. That about sums it up.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 30907, "text": "Ghosthouse - La Casa 3 (aka House: La Maldición Final) was released in the eighties when the House franchise was a pretty big business, not so big as the Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street franchises but something important. Fortunately Umberto Lenzi only tries to exploit this franchise only superficially and he creates an intimate ghost story. A young couple tries to find the answers for a strange radio phenomena and that leads them to the famous haunted house of the title, from that point they and some other guys find themselves threatened by a strange and powerful ghost.<br /><br />This movie has some cool gory moment right from the beginning. But we couldn't expect less from Umberto Lenzi. But Ghost house isn't such an extreme piece of carnage as Cannibal Ferox or other works of this extraordinary filmmaker. Ghosthouse has more suspense than massacre. Even having nothing but low-budget Lenzi delivers a good worthwhile horror flick using his imagination to give a handful of creative killings and a good use of the cameras makes the rest. <br /><br />The music is a completely different stuff, we could define it as the typical bugging synthesizer music, this is not a low point, on contrary this is the music that helps to create the uncomfortable ambient that surrounds the movie. Recommended for fans of Lenzi (yes he have some fans!), if you appreciate B-Movies and don't criticize every second of them you will find that Ghoshouse is stunning.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 35722, "text": "Craven promised an interesting career in the Horror genre with The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes during the 1970's. He made rough, hardcore, groundbreaking grindhouse cinema  regardless if they're good films or not they were unique and opened doors for a great director. Unfortunately throughout the 20th Century Craven went on and off from horror to comedy, to drama to thriller and so on but what I never knew about was his sequel to the original The Hills Have Eyes; reading up on The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 I came across an article stating Craven made the film for some extra cash. Well, I'm not surprised.<br /><br />Craven poured his heart, soul and love into the original movie The Hills Have Eyes hate it or love it, it is evident Craven put effort into it; did he with this sequel? No. Here you can see talented film makers, writers and actors putting in laughably weak efforts with a cruddy script, paper thin characters, an obscure and ill fitting Friday the 13th-esque score/vibe, silly special effects and overwhelming mountains of unintelligence. For an example; every character has a flashback within the first twenty minutes of the film and to make the movie more inept than it already is, even a dog has a flashback! This movie is a flashback extravaganza! The acting is irritating to the extent where it is painfully unbearable. One character is blind though you won't know it until she actually says so as she is so poorly written and unconvincingly acted. There is also a scene where she is running through a cabin, note: a cabin she has never been to in her whole life yet she runs through the house as though it is her very own home  blindness can mean second sight with senses perhaps, but not the way this movie does it; it just looks silly, as I said, its poorly written. Do not expect Michael Berryman to have slurred words, a speech impediment and borderline brain damage as you see here in this film he speaks quite fluently and walks like an average person; was this the Pluto we saw in the original film? Nope. If you're looking for any incestuous, inbred, radioactively mutated hill killer like the first film this is certainly not the place to look for it; especially when the mutants in this film can drive motorcycles (stylishly so). This film has no character development, bad acting and a story copied and pasted from the first and slasher formulated  this is Friday the 13th mixed with The Hills Have Eyes. For 1985 I guess that is where the money came in.<br /><br />Something that really irritated me (amongst everything else) was this spontaneous introduction of Reaper. Who is he? Where did he come from? Sure, the hillbilly father in the original film could have kept something from Big Bob Carter and not told him of his other mutant offspring but it's just...illogical, especially when Reaper is so unintentionally funny. Also, whatever happened to the other characters from the first film? What happened to Brenda, Doug or the mama mutant or any of the other surviving mutants? Not only the lack of character explanations but these new characters are simply put; murder dolls  as I said, this is Friday the 13th though the only problem in saying that is that these teenagers don't have sex, smoke drugs, drink alcohol, be naked  nothing. They're so unbelievably boring and they don't even have the classic slasher teen formula going for them  what a waste.<br /><br />The film has cheesy special effects (just look at the cover) and the script is the exact same as the first. This movie isn't even entertaining  it's just painfully awful. You see it is films like The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is why horror is very overlooked and under-rated as a genre. The non-horror viewing public slander horror films as predictable, cheesy and stupid however there are a lot of horror films out there that prove such a statement false  though The Hills Have Eyes part 2 not only encourages the \"all horror movies are dumb\" idea but takes it ten steps further. This movie has no soul and that's where I question Wes Craven as a director. It has one too many Friday the 13th elements to it and it's so unbelievably bad  but not in a good way like Troll 2 or Manos: The Hands of Fate. For me, Craven is a hit-or-miss film maker but when you read up that he needed quick cash then you should be well aware of what you're in for; The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is it.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 3721, "text": "One of the finest (anti)war movies ever made is undoubtedly the 1930 epic All Quiet On The Western Front, directed by the incomparable Lewis Milestone. 29 years later, Milestone once again turned his attention to the waste and futility of war with Pork Chop Hill. This powerful and well-made Korean War drama is not quite in the same league as Milestone's earlier classic, but it still paints a vivid picture of the harsh realities of combat, and conveys a palpable sense of the pointlessness of war.<br /><br />Lieutenant Clemons (Gregory Peck) is a honest, dependable American soldier fighting in the Korean War. He believes in carrying out orders whatever they may be, but his attitude is put to the ultimate test when he is instructed to lead an attack on a tactically insignificant hill in the dying days of the war. Issuing orders which he knows will lead to pointless loss of life, Clemons leads his men up the titular hill into a maelstrom of enemy gunfire, looking on in horror and dismay as his boys are gunned down or blown to bits in their futile quest.<br /><br />After the film had been shot, Milestone was somewhat irritated to discover that the studio had tampered with his intentions, adding a misleading last-scene voice-over which tried to suggest that the victory on Pork Chop Hill made a significant difference to the future of millions of Koreans. The film is at its best when delivering its anti-war sensibilities, especially the bitter scenes showing honest young soldiers losing their lives for no particular reason. In historical terms, the capture of Pork Chop Hill was both costly in lives and irrelevant in consequence. The performances are generally first-rate. Peck is excellent as the man who tries to justify the insanity of what his platoon have been ordered to do. He gives his best performance since Twelve O'Clock High a decade earlier. Giving memorable supporting turns are familiar character actors like Harry Guardino, Rip Torn, George Peppard and Martin Landau, all of them resisting the urge to appear as gung-ho heroes to add to the film's stance that war is a meaningless and expensive pursuit. There have been few genuinely worthy Korean War films but this one and M*A*S*H - released 11 years later - are certainly titles that anyone looking for authentic film treatments about the subject ought to seek out.", "sentiment": 0}

But Joan Crawford's 'camp' credentials are unquestioned, and 'Untamed' is a campfest. Those who like to see Joan Crawford in queen-bee mode (you know who you are) will enjoy this film immensely. Me, I liked Joan better in 'Daisy Kenyon'.<br /><br />Here, she's cast as Bingo Dowling -- yes, Bingo! -- an oil heiress who's been living in the remote jungle with two older men named Murchison and Presley, whom she calls her 'uncles'. She takes a shine to handsome young Andy McAllister, and the two of them warble some bad songs. This movie was made in 1929, when silent films were fading fast and the Hollywood studios were scrambling to prove that their stars could not only talk but even sing. Actually, Joan was a pretty good singer and dancer in 'Hollywood Revue of 1929', but her singing in 'Untamed' is quite dire. And the sound recording is bad: well below the usual high standard of Douglas Shearer and MGM.<br /><br />Speaking of which: MGM were consistently the studio with the best production values, the most opulent sets and the most stylish costumes. You'd hardly know it here. Several exterior sequences -- notably in the jungle -- have clearly been filmed indoors on a set-dressed soundstage. Several other sets are too swank for their own good. A simple little shop is kitted out like a posh emporium. As Bingo, Crawford flashes too many bangles, and her jewellery tends to rattle loudly in the bad sound mix.<br /><br />SPOILERS NOW. Eventually, Bingo shoots Andy (good idea!) but they fall in love anyway (bad idea!).<br /><br />I consider myself a Joan Crawford fan (for several reasons) but 'Untamed' is not her finest hour. I'll give some slack to all concerned, as this talkie was made during Hollywood's awkward transition period.

The kismet-touched production, which was somehow at Haight-Ashbury at the right time? Maybe it's the editing, the fractured juxtaposition of images that both disorients and clarifies, making it more than the sum of its parts? The images by Nicholas Roeg, the fluent guidance of Richard Lester? <br /><br />What about the pitch-perfect supporting cast Shirley Knight, Joseph Cotten, Richard Chamberlain (!), even Austin Pendleton, Howard Hesseman, and Rene Aberjonois (the last two mysteriously uncredited on the IMDb)? Certainly, the haunting John Barry theme doesn't hurt. And the great George C. Scott, so far removed from the pyrotechnics of a General Turgidson or Patton, anchors it all with the kind of unshowy performance that most so-called great actors never get around to giving.<br /><br />It's all these, and more. Most of all, for me it's the profound and true sadness it evokes, its humor which does anything but lighten or elevate the spiritual emptiness to which Petulia testifies. 40 years later, few movies have captured the spirit of contemporary life so well. It's terribly pertinent. And yet, Petulia is (like the character herself!) a paradox so very much of its time, as well, that it seems caught between two worlds. Time is rarely this kind to a movie, but this one is anything but a relic, much less an exercise in nostalgia. <br /><br />Life is full of regret, both for things we've done, and things we've not done.

{"id": 47509, "text": "When a \"serious\" movie is pitifully appalling, it is easy to write a comedic review. When a comedic movie falls into the same category, it is almost impossible to make sport of it  because any frivolity in the review may be misconstrued as comedic quality that the MOVIE possesses. So let me clarify from the outset: This \"comedy\" is not to be laughed at.<br /><br />Who would have thought that Mel Brooks  the genius writer/director behind Blazing Saddles, History Of The World and Young Frankenstein (a successful comedy movie wholly in the vein of this failed one  pun intended)  would be prone to helming a comedy as pitifully appalling as \"Dracula: Dead And Loving It\"? One imagines that Brooks' comic radar is so finely-attuned that he would have seen through the financial and corporate layers of this film's drudgery and simply either abandoned it and cut his losses when he saw that it was not working, or salvaged the potential high points and let the cutting room floor eat the rest.<br /><br />He did neither, which reveals that something is terribly askew in the Brooks universe. No longer is it \"good to be the king\" - Mel Brooks is merely an old man these days, his tastes no longer running congruent with his audience's; his comedy no longer as energetic or as biting as the wit of his youth (which, relatively speaking, was his late-40s anyway).<br /><br />The Brooks gag formulas are definitely still there, but seem lazily inserted as dependable fallback material, rather than inspired stylistic substance. Jokes which I can imagine my 15-year-old self repeating ad nauseam in the schoolyard, now fall flat and wearisome on inured sensibilities.<br /><br />Not only does the film suffer from rehashed and lazy gags, Brooks' direction lacks coherence and is oft-times merely cursory; there are wide shots, reverses and close-ups which serve no purpose, camera blandly flitting from one unnecessary shot to the next, not merely misdirecting our eye, but searching for subject matter to fill the frame judiciously. Many shots seem to be second-unit throwaway footage. Instead of easing back and letting the film's levity wash over me, as should have been the case, all these logistical details kept bugging my senses, detracting from the already-sparse humor.<br /><br />During the cast-and-crew screening for this film, one has to wonder whether there were any genuine laughs or whether the aura of the director's past glories tainted the crew into believing that they had a good comedy on their hands, thereby eliciting perfunctory giggles out of respect for their elders.<br /><br />In this film's adherence to the original Dracula story and noticeable neglect of comedic opportunities, not only did it fail as a good comedy, it becomes barely convincing as an A-List movie. Brooks did not need to re-make \"Dracula\". Yet this seems to be all he did  in a manner inferior to that of droves of dramatic film-makers before him. Mel's strong suit is COMEDY. So why were we subjected to a film about the infamous psychotic blood-drinker, so loosely sprinkled with jokes that they seem incongruous within the context of the morbid tale? Where you would expect punchlines, there are scene-fades; where you would expect a gag, there is exposition of the Dracula legend; where you would expect laugh-out-loud-slapstick, there are strained attempts at re-capturing youthful insouciance from laurels past. And the dance sequence between Dracula and Mina was needless padding. (Makes you wonder what DID make the cutting room floor.) <br /><br />The actors vacillate between parodying Victorian characters and actually *playing* them. Harvey Korman's Dr. Seward can almost be an actual over-actor from one of the REAL Dracula movies, whilst Steven Weber's Jonathan Harker frequently comes across as an exaggerated English nobleman from a Christopher Lee film. Peter MacNichol, though, makes the perfect Renfield  for ANY Dracula film, serious or spoof - and is the only actor who truly nails his role in this blunt-toothed parody. Amy Yasbeck and Lysette Anthony are just too damn hot to be funny: all the self-deprecating melodrama in the world is not gonna help, chickie-babes - LOOK AT THOSE RACKS! <br /><br />On paper, Leslie Neilsen's Dracula seemed like a hilarious coup, as did Mel Brooks' Dr. van Helsing, but both seemed to be laboring under the specter of their own reputations as funnymen. Neilsen playing STRAIGHT and being oblivious to his own humor is how he works best, but here he actively went for laughs, which means that even Brooks, as director, did not discern Neilsen's forte - or *did* discern it and chose to make Neilsen play against type anyway  either way, an erroneous decision. And Brooks' van Helsing seemed too self-aware of every mispronunciation he made - for the sake of schoolyard quotes - to be regarded as genuinely hilarious.<br /><br />If Mel Brooks has grown so blind that he cannot see that the comedy boat has left him onshore; if he has become so oblivious to discernment that he actually thinks this film is noteworthy enough to be considered a vital \"comedy\", the movie's subtitle may well be applied to HIM  \"Dead  And Loving It\".<br /><br />(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.thedunmore.com/POFFY-MovieReviews.html)", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 26944, "text": "What do you want from a Jet Li movie? By the time of Kiss Of The Dragon being released, many of his fans had been vociferous about how his film's were losing realism in the fight scenes. Here, teaming up with Luc Besson & Robert Mark Kamen in the writing room, Li himself set about readdressing the balance for American produced martial artistry. The result is of course a preposterous plot that should duly have been expected, but without doubt for action fans this is a real high kicker that delivers thrill after thrill as Li beats up Paris.<br /><br />The plot simply sees Li as Chinese intelligence agent Liu Siu-jian who is sent to Paris to aid in the apprehension of a Chinese drug lord. Things go belly up when corrupt cops led by Insp. Richard {Tchéky Karyo} wipe out the target and frame Liu Siu-jian for the murder. But he ain't going to take it on the chin. So with the help of prostitute witness Jessica Kamen (Bridget Fonda), he sets about clearing his name whilst perhaps helping Jessica get her life back on track too. Cue the odd couple forming a tender relationship as they shift from one death defying encounter to another.<br /><br />The action on offer here is excellently put together, there's minimal CGI and even less wire work involved. This is stunts and martial artistry produced by a master craftsman. From a unique use of a snooker ball to an exhilarating smack down with a class of martial arts students, and on to a tag team scrap with the blonde twins, this has enough biff and bam to fill the Louvre itself. Li is on fire, not only one of the toughest guys on the planet, but also one of the coolest. While Fonda is hugely touching in a stereotypical role and Karyo continues to be one of the best psycho actors in the new millennium.<br /><br />Flaws and plot holes here? Of course.

From the start, she clearly demonstrates what a tremendous talent she had. In those early vaudeville film clips we watch a bubbly girl who could charm anyone who was lucky enough to be in the audience. She was destined for greatness, and yet, as we see in this sad account of her life, everything conspired against her.<br /><br />When Ms. Garland arrived at MGM, she was put under contract and was given all the privileges. She was sadly given medication to make her sleep, as well as for waking her up. She was a commodity that the studio exploited as it saw fit. After all, she was making tremendous amounts of money for MGM. This, in the long turn, ruined her life because the drugs created a dependency she was never able to shake.<br /><br />The film helps illustrates how everything conspired against Ms. Garland in some of the choices she made, as was the case with \"A Star is Born\". The film that had all the right elements going for it, proved to be one of the things that broke her spirit, at a time when she needed all she could to make it big, after having left MGM. George Cukor and Ms. Garland were made for one another, yet, Warner Brothers decided to chop the film, perhaps robbing her of an Oscar she deserved.<br /><br />CBS didn't do better for her. Her variety show was an excellent program, but because of the time slot, it never got the ratings that were expected. The cancellation of the show was a mortal blow to her heart. Judy Garland's descent into the end of her life is one of the saddest things in the history of show business.<br /><br />In a way, watching the opening number kept reminding us of another tragic singer, Edith Piaf.

{"id": 21417, "text": "What makes the teenage years so vexing is how a young person's line of thinking evolves from the logical, unadultered mannerisms of childhood to the obstinate, interpretive idiosyncrasy of adulthood. As children, we might remember seeing things and make a simple yet direct remark about it, yet, as adults, we might see things, stop to think about it, taking into account all our past experiences and teachings, and make an \"observation\", when we soon realize that there are other people that have their own \"observations\". Worse yet is how the young person does not immediately see this transformation.<br /><br />It is during these years where we begin to contemplate a new reality, one based on indifference and hopelessness. It is here where the young person begins to interpret ideas, histories, and ideologies of all sorts, however good or bad they intend to be, and have the option of either rejecting or accepting them. This is where our hero, Angus Bethune (played flawlessly by Charlie Talbert) is thrown in. As a child, he has always been the butt of jokes and, along with his best friend Troy Wedberg (Chris Owen), the target of bullies. His protection has relied on wit, humor, and physical prowess. His love for Melissa Lefevre (Ariana Richards) is just as strong as his hate for Rick Sanford (James Van der Beek).<br /><br />Yet, showing his affection to his yearning love is, in his opinion, an unreasonable goal. What could possibly make Angus reason like this? Could it be Rick? By the time we are done with the first act we see that Rick has already managed to mentally, emotionally, and socially control Angus. Rick is also highly manipulative, as he uses his bullying tactics over Troy to betray his own best friend. As if that wasn't enough, he's the good-looking quarterback and the head of the class, which yields ostensible power to him. He shows no compassion to whoever he feels is not \"normal\", that is, whoever does not follow his concepts of physical and social beauty. Although the film does not demonstrate how Rick obtained such line of though, his mind is no-doubtedly locked in to this ideology. Aptly would Camus describe Rick and his cronies \"no longer represent men, but an idea raised to the temperature of the most inflexible of wills.\"<br /><br />What about Angus? What about his influences? He seems to have a very supportive and eccentric family composed of his truck-driving mother (Kathy Bates) and his active, unrelenting grandfather (George C. Scott). Troy, equally eccentric, provides support at school. Yet nothing works: In his mind, his positive traits (good at science, excellent tackler, full of heart) cannot overcome his negative ones (overweight, timid, reclusive). He doesn't open his blinds in his bedroom to let the sunlight in, and he already has plans to transfer to another school, where he can be accepted for once. He wants nothing to do with the outside world, which, he feels, doesn't want him anyway.<br /><br />When Rick forces Angus to come into this world, by rigging an election so as to make him dance with Melissa, Angus becomes really confused. Will Angus go to the dance or not? He can have his \"moment\" with Melissa, yet he will risk humiliation, knowing that Rick had set this up. However, the real question this second act is this: If he makes a decision, what will it be based on? How will other people and their ideas affect his decision.<br /><br />Hereafter, his support group will aggravate Angus' confusion by bombarding him with ideology. His Grampa says \"Screw 'em\" to anybody who opposes what he wants (of which includes marrying a woman thirty years his junior), demonstrating that Angus should not fear what others think of him, thus he should go. His mother wants Angus to focus on his studies, so that he can get his ticket out of Owatonna High, thus he should not go. Troy, in his whimsical self, thinks Angus needs to change his image and manner in order to find acceptance, thus he should go. Angus himself thinks that, in spite of the opportunity to dance with the girl of his dreams, he knows that Rick will make a fool out of him, thus he should not go. How can Angus make sense out of all this?<br /><br />This is where Grampa comes in. He knows his grandson very well, and he has faith in Angus' warm qualities. He even goes out to get him a nice tuxedo, albeit a plum-colored one, but Angus refuses to wear it. Angus loves his Grampa, but Angus feels weak upon the implications of the dance. This all changes, however, when Grampa dies. Early in the film, Grampa wished that Angus could talk to Melissa just once before he died. Sadly, he will not live to see this. When Grampa's fiancee April (Anna Levine) brings the plum suit to Angus, Angus realizes he has betrayed Grampa's faith in him. He will say \"Screw 'em\", and set out to attain his goal as well as his self-esteem and self-determination....<br /><br />Thus, Angus no longer sees Rick as a bully, but as a danger to his well-being. Melissa is not merely a love interest, but a token for being courageous and brave. He has a label for these people now, based on numerous levels of reasoning.<br /><br />What's so amazing about this film is how it is richly paced. You can take delight in the visual aspects of the film and show compassion for these people. Composition creates a moving experience with the story, using the warm colors of autumn. Music also plays an important role, as it balances teenage angst with feelings of longing and disillusion.<br /><br />How sad that you truly can't enjoy a film like this if you see it quickly! Angus warrants a deeper study into the nature of bullying, use of power, teenage confusion and conditioning, obesity, and the power to overcome, themes that lie much deeper into its \"after-school-special\" facade. Don't let the theme of acceptance thwart you off! I must warn you: If you felt alone and alienated in high school, this movie won't disappoint.

Quite simply, this is among the worst films Ginger Rogers ever made--partly because of its terribly unfunny writing and partly because Ginger has never been more unlikable and irritating. Like the film RUNAWAY BRIDE, Ginger plays a woman who uses men--leaving them again and again at the alter. All this is intended to be kooky, but I found myself hating her character from the start due to her selfishness and whiny voice. I honestly would have loved it if one of her many fiancés had just slugged her! While all this wasn't very promising and Ginger's performance was VERY broad and \"kooky\", the film abruptly got worse while she was on a train trip. During her dream, she imagined an American Indian beau (played by Cornell Wilde) and when she awoke, he was real and pursued her rabidly. Some of his lines were admittedly funny, but this plot wore thin almost as soon as it began.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the better (and this isn't saying much) acts in the film was the part played by Ron Randell--as a very, very effeminate and ineffectual boyfriend. He wasn't that good, but compared to Rogers and Wilde, he looked like Olivier! Try watching this tedious film if you'd like, but understand that I am a huge fan of classic Hollywood films and I really wanted to like this movie--which came off like a bad episode of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND.

The characters showed true depth and the effects of what Fanning's character had seen were wonderfully shown. The neighbors were introduced and seemed very creepy.<br /><br />Okey, now to the second hour...Why? Why? The writers had so many ways to go, why did they do the second personality ending? For those who hadn't seen it, the Dad was Charlie. It's not even the lazy routine ending that bothered me, it's that they had so many other choices! one, the couple who lost their child. The father saw him speaking to his daughter. When he went over to their house, he talked to the neighbor's wife who broke down, saying that her husband did something bad. What was that about?

{"id": 19003, "text": "The Flesh and the Fiends, also known as Mania, is one of those pleasant surprises. It is a very good film with excellent acting, a thorough, thought-provoking script, suspenseful direction, and quite a jarring, almost twisted/perverted mood. I was genuinely surprised just how good this film was, because I had heard so little about it. But I can honestly say that I found it a highly enjoyable, disturbing, horrific film. Where to begin? Let's start first with the story. The story covers old ground here(The Body Snatcher with Boris Karloff for instance precurses this)about those two infamous body snatchers of Scotland Burke and Hare and the doctor who needs dead bodies to help find cures for the sick - Dr. Knox. This film is pretty faithful to those stories. What really helps this come alive is three characterizations done by three highly gifted actors: Peter Cushing, Donald Pleasance, and George Rose. Rose plays Burke and Pleasance plays Hare and I do not think I have seen two men play such vile, degenerate men as well as these two do. They both ooze oil and shed scales with their portrayals of heartless, cold, ignorant men who don't want to work and find that there is easy money in grave robbing. Soon they find it is even easier to just kill then dig up bodies(in fact they do not dig up ONE body in this film). Rose is snaggle-toothed and has a real weird twitching laugh. He is just plain repulsive and this is one of his finest characterizations in film. The same can be said for Pleasance who also plays a bad man with such conviction. Both he and Rose fit like gloves together. But as good as these two are, the real star of the film is that wonderful, under-appreciated British screen stalwart Peter Cushing, who makes cold stoicism seem so easy. Cushing plays Dr. Knox as a heartless man only concerned with science and who never really wants to think about where these bodies that he pays for come from. Cushing plays the role to the hilt in several scenes. My favorite is where he argues with \"colleagues\" about their medical shortcomings, saying, \"incline your heads to the right Gentlemen. There you will find the door. I suggest you use it.\" I love his ability to be so arrogant and yet so witty and convincing. Cushing even goes through some kind of a catharsis in this film which he does as only he can. Director John Gilling, a great Hammer film director, shows us why he was to make such good films as Plague of the Zombies. He is very sure behind the lens and knows how to pace and create suspenseful scenes.

{"id": 26142, "text": "Head Case is a dark and chilling film, but if you solely take it in the context of a gratuitous horror film, then you are clearly going to overlook the main impetus Spadaccini is striving for. Although the acts of murder and vile mutilation are a major and indeed gruesome part of the plot, there is a more wholesome and intriguing aspect to the film which often neutralises its more shocking elements.<br /><br />The discourse between Wayne and Andrea is perhaps the strongest element of Head Case, and as much as it can be witty and incisive it can equally be cold and chilling. There are some wonderfully humorous exchanges between husband and wife and initially infers Andrea holds equal footing with her husband. But the more we observe their day-to-day activities we soon realise Andrea is nothing more than an interested spectator, and without the camera we could imagine her to be nothing more than a disinterested housewife. Spadaccini does capture this emotional dichotomy of the couple beautifully, such as when Wayne and Andrea are having a minor domestic argument in the bedroom, and Wayne considers the only way to soothe his wife's rising anger is to take her on a drive to find another hapless victim that will sooth his own.<br /><br />But when deconstructing their behaviour it seems fairly obvious this is not a gruesome tale of two serial killers, but a tragic tale of a married couple seeking to invigorate their sterile marriage. Both characters display an overt sense of emotional detachment that comes forcefully through when dealing with their victims. While Wayne dissects one such victim and discovers her to be pregnant, Andrea cannot find any maternal sympathy other than briefly pass the camera over the bloody carcass of the foetus. Ironically, this is the brutal turning point of the film when Monica enters the room to make the horrific discovery, and Wayne enacts punishment in the only way he knows best. From this moment it is clear who holds the real power in the relationship, because despite Andrea's pathetic pleas of \"That's enough,\" Wayne can only see one way of preventing his dark secret from seeping out. I am sure Spadaccini will take criticism for this shocking moment, but does enforce who is in real control of the film, regardless of the critical character of Andrea: \"Look at the mess you've made!\"<br /><br />But these dichotomies often keep you interested in the film, much as the dichotomy of Crime & Punishment keeps you interested in the motivation of Raskalnikov, and whether he will seek redemption and salvation in a greater good. But if marriage and family have not saved Wayne, then it is doubtful his moments of familial good will outweigh his greater moments of sadistic evil. For a man who can lovingly take his son on a driving lesson but sadistically ignore the crying pleas of a soon-to-be butchered mother forcefully realises how far beyond redemption Wayne has gone, and the spiral of madness he is influential for leaves little possibility of a reconciliation by the close of the film. Indeed, when Wayne seeks to initiate Andrea into his sadistic world we know there is no hope for this couple, and the sooner this nightmare is destroyed the better it will be for all concerned. Naturally, Spadaccini has the last word on this matter.<br /><br />For an independent film Spadaccini has worked hard with many genres and movie styles; considering the constraints he must have been working under. He has done very well to provide a unique experience for the discerning horror fan, and I can appreciate why this film will not be to everyone's taste. But based on the characterisation, the humour and the plot, I do think Head Case has the capacity to become a cult favourite for many others. Following on with other comments, we are seeing here the development of a very talented writer and director, who seems to be able to inject something fresh and compelling into a very tired and overdone genre.", "sentiment": 0}

There's a story of sorts (lots of people chasing a revolutionary war cannon purported to contain the Crown Jewels of England), and a moral of sorts (don't be afraid to risk), but they're just scaffolding for the gags and shtick. The script abounds in throwaway lines that have no relation to anything else (\"I haven't seen anything like this since the Bay of Pigs\"), scraps of ridiculous dialogue (the history professor sees Ernest with a possibly valuable artifact: \"Where did you get that?\" \"France.\" \"Where in France?\" \"Outside Paris\"), and all sorts of off-the-wall bits (the professor doing Elvis, the Mighty Workboy song). Jim Varney does a few of his standard issue klutzy-Ernest bits, but they just set the real humor in higher relief.

Politicians want results, soldiers want to earn a living, families want their children home, the world needs change and sometimes it seems war may be unavoidable to make the latter happen. But the fact remains: no one wants war. Yet certain people decide that it is necessary and continue to wage it at high costs of money, time, resources, and life. What seems as the film's central event - the famous flag raising on top of Iwo Jima's highest peak - is not really central at all. The great irony here of how such a small event, that happened only in the beginning of the battle, was made out to be one of the biggest drives in advertising how important it is that the American people continue to fund the war. How insignificant and even naive it is to label a handful of soldiers, who were merely following orders and trying to stay alive, as heroes that won a great victory.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has tackled issues of all sorts, especially since he directed 'Unforgiven' and this is his grandest film yet.

In fact, they get a huge amount of work in this cheesy quasi-medieval movie, playing all the extras and even some of the principals. <br /><br />The so-called premise of this stinker is that the inventor and scientist Archimedes invented a huge amount of technology, including some kind of laser. One of his assistants collected everything and hid it away in a cave somewhere in ENGLAND! Uh-huh. They did this to keep this technology away from the world, which is a good thing in my opinion. Archimedes gets killed by some Roman soldiers(what?!)-or a guy at a toga party gets stabbed by a guy in a bad Halloween costume, take your pick.<br /><br />Cut to the fourteen hundreds, where a really annoying, whiny little kid is being sold as a slave 'somewhere in Europe'. Europe the country, that is. A beggar buys the kid for one copper, because nobody else wanted him(what a surprise). The beggar turns out to be a spy for an organization called the Delta Knights(the airline?). He recognizes the girly slave boy as some kind of special prophet that the Knights have been waiting for, because he can translate a 'red book' left by Archimedes to point the way to the treasure. The puzzles in this book are so lame that a two year old could have figured them out, but whatever.<br /><br />The beggar-knight teaches the boy for six years or so(or at least that's what it feels like). The kid grows long golden curls and looks ever more like a girl, which makes me think of a good reason why the knight kept him around so long. Especially since the boy calls him 'Master' all the time...<br /><br />In comes the villain of the piece, played by the same actor who played the beggar-knight! You'd think the guy would recognize his identical twin, but no...Maybe its the stupid costume Lord Vulchare is wearing that keeps the knight from recognizing himself. It involves gold leaf, horns, and a truly silly looking cape. I'm surprised that he didn't spend all of his time swishing it. He looked like an escapee from a Broadway musical.<br /><br />Lord Vulchare captures the knight, the boy rescues him using a blow gun, of all things! And then Vulchare kills the knight.

One annoying character down, a man we couldn't forgive anyway because of an earlier scene in which he threw his own urine onto a passing 'villager'. Unfortunately, the boy-girl survives and escapes.<br /><br />He meets an Orlando Bloom wannabee in a tavern, after getting hit on by a tavern whore. The prissy artist type claims to be Leonardo Da Vinci, a heresy if ever I saw one. The kid can't even draw, I doubt Da Vinci EVER wore clothes that femmy, AND he spent the rest of the movie hitting on the tavern whore. The real Da Vinci might have evinced far more interest in the pretty boy-girl than in the overblown charms of the woman.<br /><br />The pair saves the girl from Vulchare, I'm never sure why, and set out to find the storehouse. This is supposed to involve a trip to England, but I never saw them in any kind of boat. Did they fly over the English channel? They get captured by a Robin Hood type, who turns out to be a Prince of some kind(of what, we never find out). And lo and behold, the tavern whore turns out to be his long lost sister! At this point, I had the massive urge to slap this movie briskly..<br /><br />There's a scene where the boy and Leonardo try to escape from the Robin Hood guy, and as they flee through the night a disembodied voice croons \"I'm coming...\" over and over again. Hysterical. Somebody was obviously sucking a medieval bong before they went out to chase down the dynamic duo.<br /><br />They finally find the store house, and marvel at the cheesy artifacts. Leonardo promptly appropriates all of Archimedes' ideas, proving that he was a lucky idiot rather than any kind of genius. The kid blows up the store house to keep the treasures from getting out into the world, making you wonder: \"What was the whole purpose of this movie!\" Arrgh!

I remember seeing the tape on the front of the living room set, so I pick it up and watch it and it was breathtaking in every direction, and finally gave \"Batman\" fans something to care about.<br /><br />This is the first film from the \"Batman: The Animated Series\" in which the film's plot involves Batman being framed for killing a group of gangsters; but here's the catch, the new villain is identical to Batman in terms of the cape.<br /><br />The villain is known as the Phantasm in which he makes his appearance in a gray cloak, a blade for a hand, and a silver mask (almost identical to Doctor Doom) in which his weapon is not only hand-to-hand combat, but also uses smoke as a weapon as well for distraction, and that's what he uses to kill off the first two victims in the story; by leading one to crash his car on the street from a garage to crushing a mobster with a headstone at a graveyard (this might not be suitable for young viewers); and yet, both the gangsters and the cops work together to kill Batman and the only person who believes that the caped crusader isn't a murderer is Commissioner Gordon. Even the District Attorney Arthur Reeves, wants him dead and yet he's working with the same gangsters that are involved with the Phantasm.<br /><br />Throughout the film we encounter a beautiful woman name Andrea Beaumont who makes a fool out of Bruce Wayne, and in a flashback of Bruce Wayne, its explained that the woman was the first love of Bruce Wayne, but it tears him apart when Andrea abandons Bruce by leaving with her father to France after in tides with a local mafia. The flashback also shows how Bruce Wayne started out as the caped crusader by going through different fights with criminals disturbing the peace. He uses smoke bombs and jacks to stop the bad guys and vehicles along with different techniques of combat. He discovers later in his mansion that he has a cave and in one scene of the film he's at the funeral of his dead parents and tells him that he doesn't want to fight crime; I felt Bruce's pain in this movie, unlike the other films because all he wanted to do was lead a normal life.<br /><br />With people believing Batman killing the mobsters, there is one gangster who is scared to death, Sal Velestore, who pays a visit at the old Gotham Exhibit, which the Joker lives there. Sal pays him two million dollars to get rid of Batman. The Joker makes Sal laugh to death while getting the Phantasm on tape, and now The Joker knows the true identity of the vigilante.<br /><br />During the film, Batman discovers that the gangsters who died are related to the same mafia that Andrea's father was working with and discovers that The Joker used to work for the organization. Realizing that Andrea comes back into town, he realizes that he will do everything to protect his love and try to reveal who the killer is before it's too late.<br /><br />Batman: Mask of the Phantasm proves to be one of the greatest animated films ever and the best Batman ever made.", "sentiment": 0}

Okay, it sounds a little awkward, but hey, maybe we get a well-enough crafted explanation to make it feel believable for the sake of entertainment. Alas, we don't. This movie was a huge waste of money. The writing is so horrible, i was cursing myself for not having any beer left to ease the pain. The characters were obnoxiously superficial and cliché-loaded, i could perfectly understand the actors to not be interested in bringing their characters to life.<br /><br />But nothing can beat these ridiculous ideas! Stupid actions of the protagonists take turns with the movie presenting hilarious effects of mother earth going bonkers (mostly by ignoring all laws of physics). I don't expect everything in a movie to be completely correct, after all it is entertainment, but at least once in a while something should work in theory in the real world! Research...!! Is that really too much to ask?! Oh, and the writer sees Europeans only as making nice victims in movies. At least this time it is not again the Eiffel Tower, that explodes. But again, when Mr. Scientist explains what is going on in the first part of the movie, he makes it really, really easy (not to say primitive) to understand the basic physics behind the idea of the film. And if the target audience doesn't come from Europe, who is this kinder-garden-lecture aimed for then...? But whom am i to assume... At least now i know we live on a peach which will be burned by a flamethrower.<br /><br />In short: Spare yourself or expect major rubbish.", "sentiment": 0}

Here in the Age of Innocence, Scorsese depicts (with the help of Edith Wharton's novel) of a time in New York when things when things were elegant, though also brutal in the deep. Daniel Day Lewis plays a man who is torn between marrying a woman he likes (Winona Ryder) and making her family happy as well, or choosing a tempting woman with a free mind (Michelle Pfieffer). This could sound like Arthur in the 19th century, but the director handles the material so carefully it works very well along with fine performances and excellent photography by long time collaborator Michael Ballhaus (who also provided my favorite scene in movies in the Cobana long shot in GoodFellas).

{"id": 16116, "text": "Olivia makes a tremendous leap in her acting abilities following a rather \"wooden\" (pun intended) performance as a mannequin in yet another Christmas television movie, \"A Mom for Christmas.\" This wonderful movie co-stars Gregory Harrison, whom she would also act with in the AIDS-drama \"It's My Party,\" and also marks the acting debut of her daughter, Chloe Rose Lattanzi, whom, much later, would become an international singing sensation in her own right.<br /><br />The film centers on a widowed mother of two young girls who is struggling to make ends meet in order to save the bank from foreclosing on her mountainside home. Bleak stuff for Christmas, huh? Then, along comes mean mister bank man, played by Gregory Harrison, who must give Olivia the bad news that the bank has taken over her house and she must move.

It really seems bleak, but it all works out in the end, and Olivia turns in her strongest role yet.<br /><br />It is unbelievable that this movie has yet to be released on DVD - it was a top 10 favorite the year it was made, and has been re-run on television throughout the years since. Also, with Olivia's (and now Chloe's) popularity, the movie would surely be a strong seller. Repeated viewings have proved just how strong this film is, and it definitely ranks up there with the seasonal holiday classics that are re-run every year. It's a beautiful film.", "sentiment": 0}

Wanting nothing more than to leave his family some security, he begins his unsuccessful quest to get himself killed on the job, only to find out its harder than he thought it would be.

Next in line is the fact that you don't get too many highly acclaimed Australian movies which literally dazzle all us couch-spectators. Such were the facts, experiences up my sleeve with this section of flicks, which propelled my mindset into the \"must-see\" mode. And there I was, curiously seated in front of the big screen.<br /><br />In a matter of a few minutes, it was apparent that the movie was so cleverly pre-wired to drag us into the sea of illusion that we were dealing with actual facts and figures that go behind the scenes in the Australian dance hype. It was only because of my high alert mode, that I kept on reminding myself that this was not real....only FICTION! For starters, this flick smacks of the determination, both mutual and individual, which the key characters subject themselves to, in order to play a role in the everyday competition saga which, it goes without saying, regularly repeats itself. Three categories of key-players in this game: the teachers, the students, and the parents, warrant themselves a lot of merit. For instance, not only do the children get on board, but their parents, pro-actively, push them towards the dance floor. It's an amazing game of desperation, commitment,effort by all parties involved.<br /><br />An eye-catching performance which steals the majority of the show is Mr. Jonathan. Crude? Clandestine? Do or die? Or determination verging on hysteria? Amazing how he tries to mold the mindset of his students in the bud, by asking them to imagine all sorts of shocking/horrific scenes, and making them fill in the action/reaction gaps through their dance steps.<br /><br />Good job Darren Ashton.

{"id": 45911, "text": "I was in two minds about buying this. I mean, an 80's fantasy flick in the vein of Conan sounds interesting doesn't it? At least thats what I thought. So I decided to buy this, and now I sort of regret it.<br /><br />Let me summarise the story:<br /><br />A \"holy\" warrior, Kain (David Carradine) comes across this little village that is dominated by two tyrants. Each of these have their little following of people, and both of them are arch-enemies. Basically, they're both locked in a struggle for control of the village well which is (conveniently) situated right in between their encampments. Cue our Hold Warrior, who plays the sides off against each other, to collect the rewards for doing so, but he also has his eye on a captive sorceress (Maria Socas). I suppose you can guess where the story is going from here - he tries to free the sorceress while staying alive and then there's a whole army of traders to contend with, most of which are quite angry as they were massacred before.<br /><br />Its a very simple plot, but there's just something that doesn't hit it off. The action is slow, and in between the few and far between fights, there are some quite tedious and boring places. I don't have a problem with the acting as such - I've seen much worse (but also much better) but Carradine seems a bit wooden throughout. Violence is nearly non-existent. The only blood you see is on a sword blade, and I mean, the ONLY place. The swords must be made of plastic or wood or something, because when they fight, it looks like they're fighting with stick, whacking each other over the head with not a drop of blood in sight. Maria Socas (the sorceress) goes about topless the whole movie, as you've probably heard by now. And along with the 4 breasted erotic dancer (no, its not that good) its a veritable display of female nudity. If you're after the nudity, there's far better in just about every other movie, so there's no way you should buy this just on that.<br /><br />Its a way to spend a mindless hour or so, at 77 minutes (I think) its not that long, but you'd probably be better off randomly switching on the TV. There are worse films, but this is pretty bad.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 42442, "text": "I totally disliked this film, because it just went ahead and threw the James Bond of lore out the window. The suave, sophisticated & witty super agent is gone. I'd rather not offend Mr Craig, but I must admit that he is the worst casted James Bond ever in the history of the series it's not his fault though because the filmmakers were the ones who chose him. I feel that if Mr Flemming or Mr. Broccoli were alive, they would not approve of the casting or even the spirit of this film. The film isn't terrible in a movie sense, but it doesn't fit as a James Bond film. James Bond has been well established in the cinema. Here James Bond has been reestablished as something else. You can either accept or reject it. I'm only 21, but even I will not accept this reinvention of Bond for a new audience or generation. I first discovered Bond as a child in awe of the magic of the films of old.I consumed them all, cheered for Bond and indulged in these adventures. Sadly that magic has faded, and boring realism and drama has taken the forefront in an attempt to reinvent Bond, though it may have been acceptable if the Bond was right and if the Bond spirit was still in tact. The attempt at believability was destroyed by an unbelievable James Bond, the original foundation is too great. Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton & Brosnan were all good acceptable James Bonds. Even Niven in the original Casino Royale, bond spoof was acceptable. They were all debonair gents. Craig doesn't portray that and he doesn't look or act right.

And now this, the final installment in the triumvirate of films about dashed dreams and unfortunate morals. Not that these films were all about gambling per se, but that they evoked it in spirit. For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny. You must have your Owning Mahowny. \"Just let me watch five more minutes,\" you say, \"and I swear it will get good. It's due.\" Which is a shame really, because the movie just really blows.<br /><br />In fact, they should have called it Blowing Mahowny, or Owning Baloney, or some reasonable facsimile--only then the ace detective on the trail of Mahowny would not be able to wittily observe that \"Mahowny\" spells \"How many?\" when the letters are rearranged and a question mark is inserted, which is a lazy anagram at best as it only requires two permutations. A much better one is \"O Man Why?\" as in \"O man why, o why upon why o man did this movie even get made?\" or \"O man why didn't I save that $7 for Vegas where I could be far better entertained by an hour and a half at the nickel slots?\"<br /><br />Nothing against Mr. Hoffman, who is one of the finest, most important actors of our day, but this movie has nothing to hold him up. It is not worthy of his talents. The dialogue is forced and hackneyed, never fully deciding if it wants to be moralistic or sympathetic, but always settling on being just plain crappy. The protagonist is never shown to have a single redeeming quality, except possibly in the end, when he tells his girlfriend \"I love you too\" and kisses her hand, and this is supposed to make up for the fact that she has always come in a strong second to his addiction. Apparently in real life they got married eventually, but the characters in this movie could never have gotten married in more than a postscript, because they were just too ingenuine, and the movie omits any moments that could have explained why on earth they ever got together in the first place.<br /><br />There was something maniacal about the casino boss who was so inviting to Mahowny but at the same time stood to gain millions of dollars from him and completely ruin him. A better movie would have explored this, but this one was content to revel in his clown-like antics. Elsewhere, the token black floorman and the Italian bookie were an insult to multicultural casting. And what was with the suspicious co-worker at the bank, or even more so, the scruffy cop who tracked Mahowny down? He was clearly a ripoff of Brad Pitt's scruffy cop from Seven, only in that movie, Pitt was chasing someone actually scruff-worthy. No, this movie would have been better suited with a Fedora-clad Tom Hanks in a fake Boston accent. Perhaps these characters were all based on real-life scruffy or ethnic people, but this movie didn't convince me as much.<br /><br />In the end, on a scale of 100, with 100 being Air Bud 2, I give Owning Mahowny a 20. And sure, maybe 20's good enough for some people--even Mahowny himself. But me, I just want my money back.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 13735, "text": "Neil Labute's In the Company of Men is an amazing motion picture, one of the best films of 1997 and a shocking indictment of the ego-driven corporate world in which we live. On the surface, the film, expertly written by Neil Labute in his first feature effort, seems to be a cruel tale of misogyny. Lurking beneath the surface, however, is the film's true message, one which depicts the business world as a battle of survival of the fittest, a harsh world where men sacrifice their integrity and compassion in favor of oneupsmanship and greed.<br /><br />Fed up with their failures with members of the opposite sex, two co-workers, Chad (Aaron Eckhart) and Howard (Matt Malloy) decide to play a cruel prank on an unsuspecting female victim. They will both date her, and then after a six-week period, they will dump her, a plan they've devised after years of being tormented and unlucky with women. They eventually choose their prey, a deaf typist named Christine (Stacy Edwards) and begin their quest, asking her for dates, sending her flowers, and sharing intimate moments. All this seems like a pleasant surprise to Christine after years of no dating--but, of course, she doesn't know the plan the men have hatched.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too much more about the plot than this. I will say that the film has two climactic scenes, one expected and the other inevitable in retrospect. The first climax makes the movie a success, the second makes the film great--only then do we see Labute's true intent.<br /><br />Labute's cast of no-names is uniformly excellent. Eckhart, who has since become a Labute staple, delivers a fascinating performance as a truly despicable character, the smooth and fast-talking Chad. Matt Malloy is excellent as Howard, the \"weaker\" of the two men, and Edwards is great as the hapless deaf typist, presenting her character as likable, intelligent, and sensitive, not just a stereotypical handicapped woman. But the real star of the film is Labute's script. Judging by this, and his three more recent films (Your Friends and Neighbors, Nurse Betty, and Possession--all quality films), Labute is a writer-director to monitor for years to come.<br /><br />A noteworthy comment about In the Company of Men is that it has been marketed as a comedy. Those of you expecting slapstick humor and romantic charms might be better served seeing another movie. In the Company of Men is NOT comedy. There are elements of black humor, especially one particularly depraved scene involving one of the men and an office intern. However, In the Company of Men is more tragic than comic, a look into the tarnished male psyche brought on by years of corporate stress and paranoia. I couldn't help but think of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, another film about corporate greed in today's world when I was watching this one. However, while Glengarry plays as more of a character-driven mystery and morality play, In the Company of Men is much more insidious, and it offers no solutions in the end. In fact, the final shot of the film is, in my mind, one of the most memorable in modern cinema. Just who exactly has the upper hand?....<br /><br />9/10", "sentiment": 0}

Not only did it not stick to historical facts (which would be understandable since Gregory didn't either), but it also completely changed the plot of the novel. First off, the first twenty minutes or so of Mary getting married, etc were never even in the novel, and basically wasted space in the movie. There was just so much wrong with this movie, I cannot even go into it all. I even like all three of the main leads. What annoyed me the most though, was the choppiness of the film. It never took the time to properly explain anything so that if someone who nothing of the Tudor Era walked in to see it, they'd be left dumbfounded the entire 115 minutes. Ex: If you hadn't read the book, you think \"what the heck happened to Mary's first husband?\" Also, they never shell out the characters properly. Mary, the MAIN CHARACTER, is barely in the movie at all! And you never really understand the relationship with Stafford or any of it! Hm, the one thing that irritated me the most: Henry raping Anne?

{"id": 8854, "text": "It goes without saying that by this time detective stories and murder mysteries arrive with a great deal of thespian baggage. Any filmed story that depends heavily on plot with an emphasis on finding all the clues along the way to a revealing conclusion must by its very nature owe much to established convention. Thus a review or critique seeking to find unique properties must needs look to elements other than plot. In this case one comes across excellent production values, superb acting, and an historical feel that avoids 21st century sentiment.<br /><br />To anyone who lived through the time in question, the notion that people behave differently in times of national peril is a given. Yet there was always underlying the stress and uncertainty as to mere survival an everyday kind of dealing with affairs such as buying and selling goods, attending to civic duties, looking out for one's family, and avoiding the tax man. The role of a policeman was in that sense highly valued, as this series seeks to demonstrate. Even during blackouts and air raid drills, we still had to depend on ordinary policemen to maintain order. And things like rationing and price controls lent themselves quite naturally to crimes such as profiteering and, to some extent, episodes of violence that are the stuff of all murder mysteries.<br /><br />Foyle as created by the writer was trapped by circumstance as so many of us were in roles on the home front. As one of the episodes points out, he was prevented from taking a direct role in military affairs by way of having made enemies of influential officers in the course of pursuing his police investigations. The scope of this series is broad, much more than can be conveyed in any one episode. I was particularly impressed with how the father and son relationship, appropriately played by Kitchen and Ovenden (who even bear a physical resemblance to each other), evolve over several episodes.<br /><br />Do by all means find a way to buy or rent the whole series so as to appreciate more than this or that plot.

This sets off complications that involve her whole family-her fiery sister (Kyra Sedgwick), gruff father (Robert Duvall) and understanding mother (Gena Rowlands).<br /><br />This plot has been done many times before and there are no real surprises--but it has a good pro-female script. That's no surprise--it was written by Callie Khouri who also wrote \"Thelma & Louise\". The dialogue is sharp and adult and the stars give it their all.<br /><br />I've never really been a big fan of Roberts but she is very good here faking a credible Southern accent. She has a GREAT scene when she confronts her club about her husband's infidelity. Sedgwick is just fantastic as her sister--full of fire and having a great time. Surprisingly Rowlands wasn't that good at first--way too muted but she eventually got better and is wonderful in a scene in which she tells off Duvall. Quaid and Duvall are lousy in their roles...but they're given NOTHING to work with--this picture is about the women. The only male character with any depth is Jamie (Brett Cullen)--very handsome, intelligent and caring--a real great performance. <br /><br />A word of advice--this movie is VERY R rated.

Their love for each other is torn apart by his father--but she still loves him. It all leads to a tragic end.<br /><br />I saw this in a theatre back in 1982. They tried to play it like an opera. When I walked in the screen was covered by a red curtain (back in those days some of the older theaters still had curtains). As the lights went down the curtain parted and the film began. When the film ended, the curtains pulled back together and the lights came up. My audience applauded even after the lights were up. It gave the feeling of being at a live opera. That can't be recreated at your home but this film is still well worth seeing.<br /><br />Director Franco Zeffirelli wisely did not film the opera as it is staged. He opened it up--this was set up for a film. Sequences take place outside and the inside sets are way too elaborate for an actual opera.<br /><br />The costumes are beautiful and the sets are just stunning--full of color and light. Every moment of this picture is filled with beautiful imagery. It matches perfectly with the singing and the music which are just incredible. There's even a show-stopping matador dance half-way through! I've never seen the opera but I've heard this is very faithful and Stratas and Domingo have beautiful voices and also can act! The only negative here is that Domingo is way too old for his role...but that can be forgiven whenever he sings.<br /><br />This was actually a sizable hit back in 1982.

{"id": 8017, "text": "The Belgian comedy, \"L'Iceberg,\" is such a head-scratching little oddity that it is virtually impossible to describe it for anyone who hasn't already seen it. It's a highly stylized tale of a young restaurant manager who decides to break away from her stultifying and humdrum existence after she inadvertently locks herself in a freezer overnight - only to discover, once she gets out, that her husband and their two carbon-copy young children have failed to notice her absence. Realizing her utter insignificance to those around her, Fiona strikes out on her own, abandoning her job and staying away from home for long stretches of time - eventually setting out to sea with a mysterious deaf/mute sailor she meets along the way.<br /><br />Utilizing concepts straight out of the Theater of the Absurd, \"L'Iceberg\" pokes fun at the sterility of modern life, as Fiona finally breaks free of the bonds of domesticity and goes on a quest for love and adventure. Directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon (who play the husband and wife in the film) have composed their film almost entirely of straight-on block shots, perfect for emphasizing the surreal spareness of the drama and setting. The lanky, bug-eyed Gordon, who looks for all the world like a cross between Frances McDormand and a stringy-haired Olive Oyl, plays Fiona with a mouth-breathing, deadpanned seriousness that enhances our empathy for the character and heightens the satirical nature of the piece.<br /><br />Original in concept and bold in execution, \"L'Iceberg\" is irrepressibly imaginative and visually inventive in its cockeyed portrayal of the world around us.", "sentiment": 0}

It's not a very good movie to end a brilliant career with, but it's entertaining, and the history of the cast should be mentioned: First we have Jane Powell who started out in movies as a child performer and made it to big time which is something that most child actors and actress' couldn't do. Very few made it such as Jane Powell, Debbie Reynolds both born of April Fools Day, Natalie Wood, just to mention a few. Cliff Robertson was a known actor but never really made it to star-status. Keith Andes was a fine singer and had played the lead role in Kiss Me Kate on Broadway, but never really made it in Hollywood as an actor or the excellent singer that he was. Kaye Ballard was known for her cukoo comedy talents and had appeared as one of the Wicked-Step Sisters in the original Juile Andrews version of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella on T.V., and played in the Mothers-In-Law on T.V. with the other Mother in Law Eve Arden. Una Merkel made herself into a star by playing secondary roles such as Kitty Kelly in The Merry Widow with Land Tuner and the housekeeper in Rich, Young, and Rretty, again, with Jane Powell. Kelly Brown appeared in the movie Oklahoma and Seven Brides for Seven Browthers as one of town-folks line-dancer, but if you were a dancer you knew who he was, and Tommy Noonan made himself into a star by playing secondary roles such as Marily Monores dim-witted husband to be in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, but his best role was as the gum-chewing Pianist in A Star is Born with Judy Garland. In fact, Noonan showed that he was a fine actor by stealing the last scene from Judy Garland in A Star Is Born when he tells her how pitiful she's behaving since Norman Maine had committed suicide, but there is one person in the line-dancers that's had a history that no one knows about.<br /><br />Here's in Cincinnati, Ohio, we have had our share of famous actors and actress' such as Doris Day, Tyrone Power, George Chikarus, Vera Ellen, and a very famous criminal with the initials of C.M. that we don't like to talk about. Harvey Evens is from our area. He had been studying dancing with Harris Rosedale, I know this to be a fact because I was there too, but his name was Harvey Honnacker. I guess he changed his last name to Evans because he couldn't get his last name up in lights. Too long. So, I remember one day he came into the studio and said, \"I have nothing here\" and went to study with Leo and Rita McNeil. Later he went to New York. Then he went to Hollywood where he did chorus work in The Pajama Game, West Side Story under his original name, and The Girl Most Likely. Later he did the T.V. version of Applause playing the gay hair-dresser and friend of Margo Channing played by Lauren Bacall. Since I knew LeRoy Reams who played the role originally, I asked LeRoy if he had recommended Harvey to play his role, and he said no; that he got it on his own. I'm not sure, but I heard through certain channels that Harvey passed away. What a talent he was. I remember seeing him in a dance recital given by the O'Neils when he was there and he sang a jazzed up version of Indian Love Call and did a dance ending up with his jumping up on the side on stage and back down like James Cagney did in Yankee Doodle Dandy. What a talent he was. It's just a shame he, like many others, were never allowed to show the full power of their talent in the entertainment field!", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 28814, "text": "This film is one of the most copied in the history of Hollywood, I claim. I find it is clever without being profound, its characters are unusually believable and well-developed; and it is a light-hearted look from beginning to end at a very interesting plot question--the precocity of young people who lack categorizing definitions, life-experience and therefore the context to make prioritized value decisions; in a word, it's about the problems adults have with children who want to act as grown ups without having the means to do so successfully. The central character of this film is a successful bachelor named Richard Nugent. Through no fault of his own, the artist ends up in court before Judge Margaret Turner who recognizes his innocence but warns him not to appear before her again on a similar charge, caused by a lady in a night club.,. The situation then become complicated by Nugent's appearance before a high-school class as speaker, an event at which Margaret's daughter falls in love with him despite or because of the difference in their ages. Margaret enlists his help when a casual put-off remark results in the daughter's showing up at Nugent's apartment to be painted. Her idea is to have him continue to see Susan, in the hopes the daughter will realize she belongs with someone nearer her own age. The result is merriment that takes many forms, including physical contests at a picnic where Nugent finds himself the rival of Margaret's boyfriend while trying to lose for Susan's sake; a basketball game where he must champion her erstwhile beau from the bleachers; and family occasions where the dialogue turns frequently hilarious. The best thing about this screwball comedy, to me as a writer, is the gradual development of relationships it allows the audience to share. Fundamentally, the film concerns five persons--Nugent, played with charm by Cary Grant, intelligent Myrna Loy as Margaret, pretty Shirley Temple as a fast-growing Susan, her daughter, Rudy Vallee as Grant's rival, prefiguring his stuffy role in \"How to Succeed in Business\" and other comedies, and Lillian Randolph as long-suffering Bessie, the family's maid and confidant-adviser. The happy ending achieved for all in this story-line is the result of the common sense shown by Loy and Grant; the 'screwball' aspect which is not a genre, but rather a way-of-handling social-mores comedy, is here made to serve a plot that involves several hard-working normative people in a situation that should never have happened but has in fact happened. The production values of this bright comedy are far-above-average I suggest in every respect. Leigh Harline's music is understated and very useful, and the cinematography by Robert de Grasse and Nichloas Musuraca is high-contrast B/W and very good in a number of types of scenes. Director Irving Reis and writer Sidney Sheldon keep the film's pace and style very swift and consistent. Art Direction by Carroll Clark and Albert S. D'Agostino and the set decorations by James Altwies and Darrell Silvera add to the elegance and fun of the production. Edward Stevenson provided the gowns. Among the cast, Cary Grant is very-well cast it seems to me as the suave, womanizing and genial Nugent; he also portrays exasperation very nicely, and his reading of comedic one-liners is one of his best professional strengths. Myrna Loy suggests her sensuous side so well that she fits perfectly the stuffy role of a judge who is decidedly unstuffy. Her confidant in the film other than Randolph is Ray Collins, always a great listener and man with a wisecrack or sage advice. Temple is very good indeed as a teenager; her teenaged films are for me the best of her filmic outings. Vallee created a whole new career for himself as droll comedic second-lead with this impersonation; and Randolph is very strong as the understanding servant-cum-friend. Others in the cast include Veda Ann Borg, Dan Tobin, Harry Davenport and Ransom Sherman. All the younger people in the film are well-chosen by my standards. The film introduces the nonsensical \"You remind me of a man\" mnemonic, which became the springboard for \"The Power\", Frank M. Robinson's sci-fi classic, and a fine film of the 1960s. This is a dialogue and situation comedy with elements of satire and more. It is frequently as good as its award-winning screenplay would lead one to expect it would be, and then some. Civilized angst about the younger generation perhaps never seemed to be funnier than in this movie.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 43407, "text": "I feel taken. There is no kinder way to put that. Preparing to see the prequel to some of the most epic films that have been made, I, along with most of the world, became excited at the prospect of a new chapter in the saga. A new chapter that promised to have both the charm and aura of the old while incorporating the new technology of the day. However, instead of the addition of new digital techniques to the epic story, we have the REPLACEMENT thereof.<br /><br />Take, for instance, the idea of a completely digital character. In the words of Ian Malcolm, Jeff Goldblum's character in Jurassic Park, \"Your scientists were so concerned with whether they could do it that they didn't stop to think if they should do it.\" Granted, Jar Jar ButtMonkey would have been far less intrusive (say, only as much as a proctological exam) were he not so abrasive and his voice less like the experience of simultaneously chewing aluminum foil and scraping your nails across a blackboard while a band of dwarven accordionists march in clockwise fashion around you playing an atonal interpretational montage of Bette Midler's greatest hits.<br /><br />As far as the rest of the story goes, yes, the Pod Racing and the Light Sabre fight scenes are impressive, but they are not the story. They are simply moments. What we are left with after that is a weak attempt to recapture the audience that IV, V, and VI enthralled. On point, Lucas dialogue has always been ponderous, at best (revisit some of Princess Leah's lines from the originals if you disagree). In truth, he doesn't fail to return on that promise, but the lines do not come off with the same charm that the first movies held; indeed, how could they when the lines themselves are delivered with two-by-four accuracy? I submit the first scene between Amidala and Anakin in the shop of the slave-keeper. The scene is contrived, and the dialogue hollow. The characters are not talking to each other, they are making speeches at one another. Similarly, the scene that should make even the most ardent supporter of Lucas nod a tired nod of acceptance that, yes, this scene needed work: \"I care for you.\" Any who have seen the movie know the scene I refer to and can hardly deny the malcontrusion of character and story that forced that line from Anakin prematurely in his relationship with Amidala.<br /><br />I could go on: why try to scientifically explain the ability to use the Force; why demystify what had once been referred to as an \"ancient RELIGION\"? I don't mind the allegorical reference to the Christ story (anyone who could not see the parallels in the original movies was asleep), but I do not need the thinly vieled reference to mitochondria that serves as the basis for the most potent power in the universe.

The next day, while playing golf, he shoots a miraculous putt and claims he 'hypnotized the ball' into the hole. His best friend challenges Charley to prove it by hypnotizing him and while Charley works his hocus pocus, an errant golf ball beans his pal, stunning him into a zombie-like state. Both men believe the trance was the result of Charley's powers. The next time Charley want to go out for poker night, he tries mesmerizing his spouse. She is wise to him though, having seen what really happened on the golf course.<br /><br />SPOILERS: The Missus pretends to be under his spell by not only agreeing to her husband going out with the boys, but deciding to get dolled up and go out on the town herself! She whispers instructions to the maid to leave the back door open as she isn't really going out, but will pretend to, then have the taxi driver drop her off in the alley. Charlie, not liking it a bit the goose is gandering, follows his wife. They keep bumping into each other back at the homestead, making up creative excuses as to why they returned.

{"id": 10406, "text": "John Mctierman and company have laid claim to the word 'Predator'. They have created the ultimate hunter/killer roaming the universe looking for worthy prey and this time it's Arnold (Dutch), and his able military team. This movie is fast paced enough to please action fans but also skillfully creates suspense by keeping their stalker in the shadows so that the predator feels ever present and is just cautiously eyeing and selecting it's prey. Bit by bit it is revealed to us until it's full horror is unleashed in the climatic scene.<br /><br />The casting of this movie is near perfection, except for Shane Black who was offered a bit part when he was not needed for screenwriting duties. Arnold is the ultimate screen superhero. He is seemingly invincible and his overbearing confidence makes his casting as a leader natural. His muscles, thick austrian accent and powerful name have helped him permanently claim roles as his own - Conan, the Terminator and of course this one. Without Arnold in the sequel, it was always going to pale in comparison. For the screen superhero it was obligatory to have an adversary from outer space. Only in this way was Arnold going to have to use all that he had to overcome the invader. This is the match - up that moviegoers will want to see - the world's superhero trying to save us from a threat from outer space. Although this sounds reminiscent of the 40's and 50's when Hollywood capitalized on people's fears of a threat from outer space, this movie far transcends those B grade movies.<br /><br />His crack unit is composed of some of the most outlandish characters the action genre has to offer. There is Jesse Ventura, the loud and attention seeking ex - professional wrestler. His gun says it all - everything is over the top with him. Sonny Landham is the indian with a sixth sense. It is this contribution that adds to the movie's suspense - he senses the Predator and quickly comes to realize that the team is up against something stronger than them. This unnerves the others since Billy is always the calmest and is able to access the enemy and give his team the advantage. Then there is of course the seasoned screen professional, Carl Weathers. He is always in top physical condition and this along with his smoothness, is ideal for his role as the ex - ops boy who becomes a collar and tie agent - a job that requires different values and he now uses the men he used slog in the trenches with. This grouping together of such strong personalities must have created a very competitive atmosphere which would have translated into better performances. Notwithstanding this fact John Mctierman must have had a big balancing act on his hands.<br /><br />Arnold's contribution to the movie was not just that of the leading character, he also recommended Stan Winston after the first Predator creation was curtly rejected by John Mctierman. His creation embodies all one could imagine that the alien predator could have. It has missiles, spears, blades as talons, camouflage, infra - red eyesight and can deftly move within any environment. Of particular note is how the predator looks. It is the personification of our nightmares. Our fears tend to exaggerate our monsters and they are endowed with unnaturally long claws, glaring evil eyes, excessive mandibles ending with unusually long teeth and they are of immense size and strength. This is spawned by Stan in his alien predator creation. Undoubtably he is the man best able to create these monsters that haunt us at night.<br /><br />Although there are scenes that remind you of the 70's slasher flicks, it is never done for the sake of it. These scenes show us how deadly the predator is and how it can swiftly attack and disappear without trace. The fact that highly trained team members are being killed in this way makes the rest feel vulnerable to the point of cracking. Unlike these slasher films the acting is better, no - one is helpless and these scenes fit into the story and are not the excuse for it.<br /><br />The climatic encounter is fantastic. Dutch uses all his capabilities to overcome the predator, but when facing his end the predator sizes him up as an opponent worthy enough to face unarmed. It had found a prey that by facing in unarmed, pure combat, it would prove itself as the true warrior. It's drive to be the ultimate warrior is it's undoing since it affords Dutch the opportunity to lead it to a trap.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention is the powerful military soundtrack thus setting the tone for a meeting of two great forces where one will stand and one will fall.<br /><br />", "sentiment": 0}

It's funny; it could have been funnier, but for something I never heard of before a street vendor offered it to me, it ain't bad. The acting is generally acceptable; the camera-work is utilitarian. Technically, it succeeds in some ways, e.g., the steadicam work, but fails in others, e.g., under- and over-exposure, or their digital equivalents. The dialogue is in Kiwi, i.e., \"english\", but it would benefit from subtitles, also in English, as in The Harder They Come.

Jayston plays wonderfully the role: all the attributes that Bronte wrote about her hero are well argued by Jayston's fine, subtle and clever acting: tortured spirit, sometimes stern and abrupt, sometimes kind and genial, eccentric, good story-teller, full of passion, masterful, yet submissive in Jane's presence, with deep and mellow voice, and playing a cat-mouse game with Jane. Jayston managed to bring the character to life as none before of after him has managed; the viewer never has the feeling that he \"plays\", that he is artificial; he really becomes Rochester while on screen and looks like he feels any line and any movement he is acting. Nothing over-elaborate as it was with Hurt's Rochester (96 version), nothing theatrical or bombastic as in the case of Dalton's Rochester (83 version), nothing staring or predatory like Welles's Rochester ('44 version), and definitely nothing unpleasant or out-of-range (or rage) as with Hinds's Rochester.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 28486, "text": "This is one of the early movies in the long career of Akira Kurosawa and a brilliant movie nonetheless. This movie can be considered the first of the Japanese police dramas. The main topic of the movie seems to be post World War II Japan. The movie deals with the similarities and difference between the cop and the crook. They are very similar in background (both were veterans of the war, both had their satchels stolen), yet ended up on opposite sides of the law. Kurosawa is showing the effects of the war on Japan. Where some steal and take the criminal way out to survive, others survive by doing what is right (and harder - as characterized by Harumi's speech to Murakami about the dress from Yusa). Even in this world, the criminal is not truly ruthless. Kurosawa accurately captures the feel of postwar Japan, by actually filming in its locations (when Toshiro Mifune travels through the market - those are actual shots of the black markets in various cities). So dangerous it was to shoot there in fact, that the \"feet\" of Murakami were actually a body double (or foot double) for Toshiro Mifune. Kurosawa uses the actors that he uses in so many classic movies - Toshiro Mifune (a breakout role for Mifune, who had been typecast as a yakuza in his movie roles thus far), Takashi Shumura (Detective Sato) and the first movie appearance for Minoru Chiaki. This movie starts out rather slowly in the progression of the action (Murakami's gun is stolen on a bus - revealed in a flashback to a superior), but picks up quickly once the Sato is assigned to help Murakami. This movie is recommended to any fan of the Japanese cinema, of Kurasawa, and of the police drama.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 38504, "text": "I remember during the promo phase for this megablockbuster superhit, Zwick and Cruise were sitting at a low table, Japanese style, for an interview with some IFC types. They didn't smile, and held a rigid posture that reeked of pretension, as if to say, \"We are involved here in a mighty weighty meaningful respectful project for the ages, and we really really understand this Oriental mystic deepness thing.\" Well, they don't.<br /><br />Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai is a good example of stupid writing and ham-fisted acting, typical of all his movies after Risky Business except Magnolia. He's shoved into the role of a masculine hero with a babe on the side. Think of it -- he's a fighter jock sleeping with his aeronautical engineer instructor; he's a pool shark with a girlfriend; he's a race-car driver making it with his doctor. Here, he's a soldier cum Samurai lusting for the widow of a man he killed in battle.<br /><br />The clichés don't stop there. The tired conceit of a diary is used to shovel soliloquies into the audience's maw between mouthfuls of popcorn and Sno-Caps. \"These are the most disciplined people I've ever seen,\" Cruise narrates in a voice-over. Later, he says, \"These people are really spiritual!\" Unable to comprehend discipline or spirituality, the writers choose not to illuminate the concepts with dramatic subtext and action, but simply to include the two words.<br /><br />At one point Cruise, who is in love with the widow of a man he killed, is presented with a dramatic opportunity fraught with promise. He sits down next to her on a tatami when she is alone. Close-up on Cruise's painfully wrinkled brow, connoting deep thought and painful deep emotion. \"I'm sorry,\" he says, in a deeply pained voice, \"... your husband.\" Does he help her, do something for her, dedicate himself to her or provide an active indication of his sorrow? No, he dumps a word on her over a cup of tea.<br /><br />At another point, a young man tells him to fight with \"no mind.\" So he mouths the words \"no mind\" whenever he fights from then on. Instead of truly creating a condition of no mind, he fills his brain with the words, \"NO MIND.\" Evidently, it's a shallow vessel but quite deep enough to contain oodles of on-the-nose monologue.<br /><br />Sitting through over two hours of these missed opportunities is bad enough, but at the end you'll be pummeled by the Hollywood happy machine on steroidal overdrive. The weak Emperor suddenly grows strong. The deeply corrupt minister is defeated. The downtrodden masses (referred to as \"the masses\") are given land. The mortally wounded Cruise is revived. The Japanese widow who spurns him suddenly drips with lust at his smile. Two malicious officers become Samurai supporters. Even the opposing army genuflects to their victims. All to a saccharine voice-over track with swelling music.<br /><br />One of the peak experiences of my movie life took place a few years back when the Music Box Theatre in Chicago held a month-long Kurosawa/Tifune festival, playing every film made by the pair.

{"id": 28851, "text": "For the particular movie fan, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, is a slice of intensity, wonder, and subtlety that can only come from Europe. The director/co-writer, Jacques Audiard, has taken a film previously made by James Toback called Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel in the role now occupied by Romain Duris, and made it his own. If I had seen the original version I would make a couple of comparisons to it (at the least, for those who didn't see the original the remake makes you want to check out the original, if only for the acting appeal of Keitel). However I did think about another wonderful French film in the vein of this film- Francois Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player.<br /><br />While Truffaut's film is a little more concerned about the lead's relationship(s) with women, I felt a kind of connection between the material of the two pieces- sometimes intense, usually lyrical, tales of a person trying to find what fits more for them, the more criminal side, or the artistic side. And, much like Truffaut and his other New-Wave counterparts, Audiard successfully takes an American formula picture and forms it well into a French setting.<br /><br />There are a few reasons to recommend the movie, one would be for the music, which gives repeated but specific renditions of a Bach tune. Another would be just for the technical-side, which is well-done in hand-held, neo-noir style by Stephane Fontaine. Another could even just be for how Audiard tells his story, or sometimes doesn't tell it: a couple of times mid-way through the film, I wondered if the story of this character would 'go' anywhere, which can either make or break a film of this kind. It pleasantly (or intensely) did, bringing a catharsis for a viewer by the final scenes.<br /><br />But likely for most the prominent reason would be for the realistic acting, in particular by its star Duris. As I said, I can't make comparisons between a heavyweight like Keitel and Duris (whom I've never seen in a film before this), but on his own terms Duris creates his character believably. It's at times a complex character, or sometimes not- he has that kind of attitude and face where you don't know whether he's really a 'street-level' guy or more straight laced. The split that is also apparent in the character's parents, one a classic pianist who's passed on (the mother), and the other a more criminal-type of a father, also gives the film an added boost of psychological energy. The lead in this film, much like with the storytelling (or lack of it), dictates how it may turn out.<br /><br />In the end, Audiard and Duris make it compelling enough for the film to be about him, his conflicts, his lusts, his music. It's a wonderful movie that seems to have passed under the radar (it's in only a few theaters around the area) amid other independent summer fare, but if you're an enthusiast of character-driven thrillers that give a bitter-sweet edge, it's a must-see.", "sentiment": 0}

The directing is at times questionable though, there is little sense of pacing and there are some parts that feel tacked on (the crazy flumride anybody)just because its supposed to be a summerfranchie. The cute little girl is completely superfluous, and Bill Murray and Treadaway's Doon doesn't make enough with their characters (or isn't allowed too). One thing is clear. Its strenghs of this film mostly resides within the source material(witch i haven't read though). Its really nice for a change to see a fantasy film without a lot of monsters, the enemies here are brain-stagnation, greed and selfishness. Some parts had me snickering. The parts where they are handed there jobs through lottery (a jab at communism?)and the old man with the pipes. THe story is actually pretty good, not original, but tightly woven and deceivingly fresh with a timely message. In short, the source-material had the brains, but the director lacked the guts (or maybe just the talent, or were assasinated by his studio) too go through with it.<br /><br />Still, it beats the latest Narnia installment, and the latest Harry Potter too for that matter. Also, Ronan, the kid from Atonement, turns in a good performance.", "sentiment": 0}

I admit, the idea is intriguing-- an old man writes a novel about a bunch of lawyers being killed, and then dies himself, but not before showing the book to a disbarred lawyer who claims it as his own & makes a ton of money, but oops! the book isn't fiction & our protagonist winds up implicating himself for the murders. A decent idea is royally fouled-up. What's so bad, you ask? Gosh, what's not? It's hard to narrow it down to 1,000 words. For starters, the terrible makeup. Latex wrinkles alone does not an old man make. Ok, so then let's throw in an --ultra-fake-- English accent to distract you from the fact that this man does not walk, talk, fish, or drink like an old man, ie: SLOWLY. No, it's clearly a guy in disguise & I find it terribly ironic that it's *spoiler* a DRAMA teacher in disguise! Well, you know what they say, Those who can, DO, those who can't, TEACH. Clear case of that going on with this character. (And that's only one of 3 disguises!)<br /><br />Alright, lets talk about the costumes. Like do you really think that if a lawyer was on the run, hiding in his hometown, that he'd be wearing his usual lawyerly 3-pc suits? Um, no. Come on, shave your beard, put on a tshirt, throw a cap on... we know you have 'em, you wore them in the fishing scene. Or Tom Berenger's \"I'm wearing a fishing hat, I must be coming back from vacation\" look. What shall we dis next? the dialogue? direction? cookie-cutter characters? voice-over? Cuba's \"performance\" consisting only of earnest wide eyes & a clenched jaw? Hell, he did the same thing in \"Radio\", but with a different walk. What about the criminal misuse of Mariane Jean-Baptiste who deserves much, much better than this? Or how about that ending? I won't give it away, but everything gets wrapped up in a lovely little package, but all we get to see is the wrapping paper. It makes no sense. I guess for everything to be explained-- why is she friends with him again? who exactly was that lawyer? why was the judge smiling?, etc-- they wouldve needed to add like another 20 minutes to the running time.<br /><br />So anyway, if you want to get together with a bunch of lawyers or film geeks, this might be a fun movie to roast, but why not rent an actual good movie instead?", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 15225, "text": "A superficial description of the movie would be something like this: A group of very close friends, profiled as of middle-class many of whom are university students, go to a bar and get wound up being tortured in many ways by some psychopathic lowbrow blue collar backstreet mob-so how dangerous it is to spend the night outside, or what has become of Istanbul or the world, the world's gone crazy and watch your backs,and so on and so forth...<br /><br />But getting tangled up in the simple and psychologically very effective narration of the movie and downplaying what it has to say would be not reading between the lines.<br /><br />This movie is a very realistic expression of the outcomes of social stratification, poverty, and inequality on different parts of the society. In this movie, you are let into the minds of whom many like to refer to as psychopaths and see the world from their eyes. You understand their reasoning, loss of aim and the slow transformation from troubled people to those -after having been made to accept being outsiders- who have lost everything they have and thereof can do anything, regardless of any value and concept associated with humanity such as love, affection, empathy,honor,self-respect. The psychos in the movie hadn't committed any crime till the story, none was recorded a least. And the crime committed the night of the story was not planned. This alone explains the threshold concept.<br /><br />You see that they do not come out of the blue, instead they are created by the system and after having been victimized to the point of losing their humanity , they turn up in the scene to respond to all this, and their response does not have a particular aim, it is nothing but the fight for existence, the timing of the response completely depends on the threshold of the ability to stand more of it/or not. When this threshold limit is exceeded, they respond to whomever they find available. The response has a particular purpose, the declaration of existence of the self, but it does not aim at a particular person. That is why these guys, in the film, choose a group of very innocent young persons as the object of their violence.At that point, it is a matter of life or death, anyway. So they don't care who they victimize, nor where they will wind up in the end.<br /><br />The film is very successful at displaying the contradiction between the judgment of what these psychos do and how they should be regarded within the society and what that observation tells us about them.<br /><br />It is also damn good at explaining the influence of this system on different parts of the society. Without getting didactic, it just tells a non-fiction story that takes place within a relatively short time. And the lines of each character is so realistic and to-the-point that you really get sorry.<br /><br />You get the wider perspective, the individual perspective and see how they interact.This is what makes the movie exceptional. You see both sides of the story and then the whole story. And even if you knew it all from the beginning, you feel like you were reminded of something long forgotten.<br /><br />I got very sorry but I can say that this movie was one of the best I have seen in the world. there aren't any pleasant scenes, there are no adventurous elements, no effects other than blood and gore. but in terms of story and its artful cinematic adaptation, the movie is one of the richest in terms of characters, points of view, narration, expression, and most of all, meaning.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 38996, "text": "I had heard about this film and that it was supposed to be a comedy and an alternate history. I'm fairly open minded and don't like to judge a book by its cover...or by other people's review of the book...so I decided to get the movie from Netflix and check it out for myself.<br /><br />Now Mr. Willmott is a professor of film at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. With this knowledge I expected an interesting piece of work...well, I guess you could say interesting if you were really stretching for a definition in this case.<br /><br />If this is an example of what a film professor is teaching his students...I pity his pupils. Willmott can't make a good film to save his life. At this point, I'm not speaking of the content, I'm speaking of the directorial style...or lack there of. The movie was poorly made. I've seen better fan films made with VHS.<br /><br />Now, on to historical accuracy...or inaccuracy.<br /><br />Willmott is full of crap. I don't know where he gets off making a film like this. Comedy? I think not. It takes a lot to get me riled up but this film hit all the right buttons.<br /><br />I'm a Southerner first of all and I don't appreciate the gross inaccuracies that Willmott made in this film. Yeah, I know it is supposed to be fiction, but blatant lies and obvious racism on his part do nothing to make our country better. On the contrary, it makes the situation worse by filling peoples heads with blatant mis-reporting of history and human attitudes towards slavery.<br /><br />Don't even get me started on him attributing the slash and burn policy of Sherman to Genereal Lee...and also his gross misrepresentation of George Washington.<br /><br />His assertion in the film is that if the South would have won the War of Northern Aggression (AKA the American Civil War) that we (as a nation) would still be condoning slavery...not out of a need for inexpensive labor (which is a fallacy in its self), but out of a sentiment for the ways of the Old South. Slaves weren't cheap in the 1860's...hell, they never were...but if you take his perspective on slavery you'd be lead to believe that everyone below the Mason-Dixon line had 3 or 4 slaves to take care of a 3 bedroom ranch home.<br /><br />Additionally, his idea of a Slave Shopping Network on cable TV is not laughable, but is totally absurd. To make it even more atrocious, his speculation of a Confederate peace pact with Nazi Germany is even more nonsensical.<br /><br />This man may have studied film, but he is no student of history...and is obviously no scholar on human behavior, technology's influence on the American Industrial Revolution or other issues that would have caused the natural extinction of slavery in the US...even without the War of Northern Aggression. He also fails to note that the Confederate Constitution itself outlawed the slave trade in the confederacy.<br /><br />Willmott's overlapping of the institution of slavery and the ideas of racism just add to the confusion and lies propagated by this \"work\". This film does nothing to heal the wounds of racism...it merely rubs salt in them and undoes much good that has been done by much better men such as MLK Jr. and others who strived and died to help make our country a better place than it has been in the past.<br /><br />Please Mr. Willmott...step away from the camera. You are dangerous.", "sentiment": 0}

I'm English so I don't fully understand the in-fighting between the Russian Mafia that goes on. The violence and shoot-outs are excessive but maybe that is the way it happens over there. The music is especially good even though I can't understand what the words are. Sergei Bodrov (The main character) who plays Danila Bogrov in both films is an excellent actor. It's a regret because there are probably loads of excellent foreign-speaking films out there that people could enjoy but can't be marketed.<br /><br />The problem with both films is the fact that there are elements of racism involved, plus the fact that World War II is often mentioned. I'm not sure, but the War must have affected them so completely that they still go on about so much, especially in Brother 2. A lot of the weapons that these guys use against each other are WWII orientated. Russian mind-set must be different to our own but these two films are must watch.<br /><br />Brother 1 concentrates purely on St. Petersburg, but Brother 2 involves Moscow & Chicago, especially concentrating on the differences between two of the major cities in the World. I don't want to spoil the film for you too much but Danila walks into a Black bar in downtown Chicago. Everyone stops talking & looks at him. Being new to America, he doesn't get that it's wrong.

{"id": 17153, "text": "Disney's \"The Hardy Boys\": \"The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure\" (1956) is based on Franklin W. Dixon's (aka Edward Stratemeyer) \"The Tower Treasure\"- the first of many \"Hardy Boys\" books. It was the first of two \"Hardy Boy\" serials produced by Disney for its \"Mickey Mouse Club\" show; which was broadcast from 5PM-6PM each weekday. The one-hour show was broken into four segments with this sort of serial taking up one of these 15-minute segments. The \"Spin and Marty\" serials were also used for this purpose. <br /><br />As in the books, Frank (Tim Considine) and Joe (Tommy Kirk) are the teenage sons of Fenton Hardy (Russ Conway), a private detective. Following in their father's footsteps the two boys are looking for a pirate's treasure supposedly hidden in the Applegate Mansion in their neighborhood. The series has a cool theme song (see below). Despite the song there are no pieces of eight. They were one ounce Spanish silver coins, worth 8 reales, or half of a gold dubloon. <br /><br />Frank and Joe are assisted by Joe's girlfriend Iola (Carole Ann Campbell) and hindered by their Aunt Gertrude who is looking after them while their father is out of town. <br /><br />The Applegate mansion is a spooky looking house and when the boys finally meet the owner he confirms that there really is a treasure, given to his grandfather by LaFitte the pirate as repayment for when he burned the Applegate plantation. His grandfather hid the treasure and no one has been able to find it since. <br /><br />The story has gold doubloons and crooks, and Iola gets a lot of scream queen moments. \"Applegate's Treasure\" was my personal favorite of all the MMC serials. The only drawback is that it was a rather complex mystery with a lot of misdirection, and having to watch it in a cliffhanger serial format was extremely frustrating. No sooner had they cleared up the suspense from the last episode than something would happen and they would break off- telling you tune in for the next episode. But we were hooked and faithfully tuned in day after day. A lot of family plans were altered during this time so as to not interfere with daily viewing. <br /><br />Watching it now I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the performances by the child actors; especially Campbell and Kirk. The serial is definitely several notches above \"Spin & Marty\" in what was demanded of the cast, and for the most part they come through. <br /><br />The DVD has some nice special features including a 2006 interview with Considine and Sands in the Disney Studio where the serial was filmed. Also included is the entire (hour-long) MMC episode in which it premiered. It was a Monday, which was \"Fun With Music Day\", and Darlene does a lengthy song and dance number with Bobby. <br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child. <br /><br />\"Gold dubloons and pieces of eight, handed down to Applegate? From buccaneers who fought for years for gold dubloons and pieces of eight. Handed down in a pirate chest, the gold they sailed for east and west. The treasure bright that made men fight, till none were left to bury the chest. So now the gold and pieces of eight all belong to Applegate. The chest is here but wait...now where are those gold dubloons and pieces of eight?\"", "sentiment": 0}

Personally I would have liked a bit more depth into Bishop's character as to why he behaves as he does.

{"id": 49873, "text": "The first problem I have with this film is in it's opening titles claiming to be based on a true story. This sets you up with anticipation that the filmmakers have developed this film aiming for authenticity, recreating what it was like to be the first fighter pilots in the first modern war. For the first time films makers have the tools with CGI to truly accurately portray the visceral effects of WWI dog fighting to put the audience right back into the thick shell smoked 1916 western front.<br /><br />However they fall VERY short of the mark because through their obsession with their aerial money shots, they seem to have forgotten the human story of the true horrors of combat and what it does to the human soul. In the fact it's the human story that the director makes the biggest hash of. It's Horrors of war painted by numbers, lets have the veteran seen it all, lets have the fearless guy and then just so people know war can be nasty lets have a shell shock guy. But this is done so distastefully it truly mocks people who have actually been traumatized by war.<br /><br />This films claims to have the most authentic aerial combat footage ever put to film. The CGI shots are also no where near as good as the film makers think they are. In many cases they come across as in game movie footage from an Xbox360, cartoon like and unreal. The filmmakers have also made no effort to research their period, without creating any spoilers there is some truly ludicrous almost James Bond like action set pieces that take away all sense that you are watching a realistic war film. The bi-planes might as well have afterburners and laser beams and fly into space, the film wouldn't be any less believable and probably a lot more interesting.<br /><br />This is nothing more than a boys own story; where the first casualty is truth or realism. It has a TV movie feel and the acting is so bad you couldn't care less who lives or dies by the end of it.

{"id": 18347, "text": "This was directed and co-written by Joseph Mankiewicz. The cast includes John Hodiak and Richard Conte. Almost all the scenes are shot at night around Los Angeles and on the lot. It ought to be good but in fact it's no more than routine.<br /><br />Let's recall John Huston's superb \"The Maltese Falcon,\" in which the hero, Sam Spade, is hired to find a fabulously expensive statue of a bird whose trip through time has left a trail of dead bodies behind. Spade searches for the statue, discovering a little more about it each time he runs into the colorful and quirky figures that are associated with its pursuit. The Fat Man, the Gay Levantine, the dame with the past, the Gunsel -- they come crawling out of the woodwork, enough of them to make a minion. In the climactic scene they are all brought together in Spade's apartment, where all is explained. And they leave, only to have Spade ring up the police and clue them in, except for the Ambiguous Dame who is revealed as the chief villain.<br /><br />I suspect \"The Maltese Falcon\" must have provided the model for this dark mystery, though enough cosmetic surgery has been performed to disguise the features of the original mold. Instead of the mysterious \"black bird\", John Hodiak, the man with no memory, pursues his own past and the two million dollars hidden somewhere within it. He runs into a gang of colorful and quirky characters. The Fat Man here is just a guy with a sinister face and a German accent and a classy phraseology. The Gunsel is a huge \"tub of lard\" who is barely able to string three sentences together. There's no Gay Levantine, but a few other characters make up for his absence. The Ambiguous Dame is split into her two constituents -- the louche broad who slings around French clichés and the honest, brave Nancy Guild who falls in love with Hodiak (and vice versa) two minutes after they meet. Hodiak is beaten up by the hoods, just as Spade was. At the end, he demands a \"fall guy\" for the police, just as Spade did. The hoodlum gang, instead of leaving, just shrug and their leader tells them philosophically that \"the jig is up.\" The friend turns out to be the real scheming murderer -- Spade's Ambiguous Dame there, a secondary but likable character here.<br /><br />The direction is okay. Mankiewicz was no slouch. And some of the writing is passable, as is Hodiak's performance as George Taylor and, especially, Lloyd Nolan's as the police lieutenant. The rest are pallid facsimiles. There are, in fact, too many quirky and colorful characters and none of them could act. Neither could Nancy Guild, although she was attractive enough.<br /><br />Hodiak's pursuit of his own identity, his pal Larry Cravat, and the two million bucks grows tiresome -- and confusing too. There are too many leads, too many red herrings. We watch Hodiak travel from place to place, mostly meeting with hostility from people who don't even know him, garnering little scraps of information which may lead somewhere, or maybe not. The musical score has no lilt to it. And the characters have only one note on their instruments, except for Nolan who delivers sarcasm and irony with effortless aplomb.<br /><br />Mankiewicz was to do much better, later on. These semi-noir mysteries were not his forte, though he made another one of them and that one, \"No Way Out,\" was pretty damned good.", "sentiment": 0}

With twisted love among an unfaithful husband, a heartbroken wife and of course, the lover, a salon owner, the story seemingly is trying to tell how the mystery can evolve into something to grab peoples' heart. Unfortunately, it rapidly runs into mediocre with basically no surprise at all. Its acting can't score anything either.

When I found out that only Series 1 was available on video, and that the BBC had failed to release Series 2, Series 3 and the two part special Tenko Reunion on video, I was hopping mad, I can tell you!<br /><br />Finally, UK Gold repeated the entire series last year, and thanks to a fellow Tenko fan named Patsy, I now have the whole thing on video for me to watch over and over again!<br /><br />The characters in this series are so real, that the viwer really does care for them deeply - Ann Bell is Marion Jefferson, the wife of a British army colonel, who finds herself appointed leader of the British women; Sister Ulrica (Patricia Lawrence) is the formidale nun, leader of the Dutch internees; Beatrice Mason (Stephanie Cole), the determined, no-nonsense doctor; Major Yamauchi (Bert Kwouk), the strict but at times compassionate commandant of the camp; nurses Kate Norris (Claire Oberman) and Nellie Keene (Jeananne Crowley); and so on, were just some of the protagonists who made this series so unforgettable.<br /><br />Some of the most dramatic storylines occurred in Series 2, where a Eurasian woman, the evil Miss Hasan (Josephine Welcome) and a sly internee named Verna Johnson (Rosemary Martin) called the shots. Series 3 took place in Singapore, when the War had ended and the women had to cope with being free, trying to get used to their lives after years of imprisonment.<br /><br />Gruelling, dramatic, shocking, funny, gripping - Tenko was all of these things, and much more. If it is ever on television, I urge you to watch it.<br /><br />FYI: I recently met the actress Louise Jameson, who was so brilliant as Cockney Blanche Simmons in Tenko. I told her how much I loved the series, and she said that Tenko was her favourite acting job of all time - and she's been in Doctor Who, Bergerac and EastEnders to name just a few!", "sentiment": 0}

This was one of the most awful, insufferable Australian movies I have ever seen. And I *am* Australian. I don't like to dis movies made in my home country, but this movie most certainly deserves a damn good thrashing. Mindbogginlingly stereotypical, annoying and boring as watching sh!t fester. Good thing I didn't have to pay money as well to see it (Borrowed a friend's video). I'm glad to see by other reviews I'm not the only one who despised it, annoyed that my time and intelligence were so sorely insulted. Toni Collette's atrocious overacting (nothing personal though), especially in the unconvincing grief scenes did nothing to help this lamo movie, in fact made it worse and I only watched it to see if it got better. Needn't've bothered. The first part of it was boring as hell, then the second half was just plain God damn depressing. I was hoping to learn more about the outback and more about Australian geology and have more scenes with Toni's character's work (she was supposed to be a geologist), rather than this annoying yuppie chick, having major league hissy fits and non-stop winging.<br /><br />And the movie was just *starting* to get good, he was just starting to loosen up and enjoy himself and then he dies ... and it goes even more downhill from there than when it started - hard to believe but true. <br /><br />I was hoping for a sensual, spiritual and moving journey through the outback, not some b!tchy angsty crap that thinks it's good because it's got people screaming in it and call it acting. The \"death scene\" did not even seem convincing, at first I thought the guy was playing and going to pop up and scare her or something. It did not seem the water was that shallow where he dived - and with arms outstretched? If he was hurt the worst that would have happened is he would have broken an arm or wrist. What a cop out just to kill him off and get out of writing anything more intelligent or insightful. Who gets paid to write these idiotic movies (and gets them produced) when there are literally *millions* of good writers out there who struggle their guts out to get their stuff out there to knocked back at every turn? Very disappointed. This \"Story\" could have been great with more of a journey, more soul, feeling and more about the outback and what *real* Australian geologists do... As we Aussies say: \"Bugger.\" Waste of time, talent and videotape.<br /><br />The only good thing of this movie was the beautiful outback scenery, the wonder and the danger, and two cultures learning each others differences - other than that it was overrated melodramatic, pathetic hype. Actually, I spent more quality time updating my webpage whilst watching this over-rated boof-brained, sad attempt of what could have been a wonderful story.<br /><br />Want to see a brilliant Aussie movie with non stop action, feeling, and a sense of awe and wonder - watch \"Gabriel\" Made only four years later with much less money and a lot more soul - literally. I found \"Gabriel's Story\" much more convincing, heartwarming and awakening.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 35466, "text": "Steven Seagal wears a suit and tie for the entirety of the movie. Unfortunately for him, this doesn't help to hide his huge bulk. I spent most of the movie thinking about how fat he's become since the last Seagal movie I watched (which must have been \"Hard to Kill\").<br /><br />The basic plot of the movie is revealed very early. This is no surprise to anybody. What is a surprise is when there's a gunfight scene and a dozen characters appear who have no other part in this movie and kill each other. Even Steven Seagal has two partners who appear for 1 minute at the beginning of the movie, then 1 minute halfway through the movie, and both are killed only 2 minutes later.<br /><br />The special effects are distracting. There's a scene where the two main characters are sitting in a helicopter on a roof. Except it's not on a roof, it's in the studio and the foreground looks washed out and Steven Seagal's tie flickers due to the blue screen.<br /><br />The DVD cover shows Seagal wearing a black leather jacket - which he does not wear in the movie - and his face has been photoshopped to look younger and thinner than it actually is. The back of the DVD shows Seagal holding two guns crosswise - a technique he does not use in this movie - and indeed it's a younger, fitter Seagal holding those guns, wearing that leather jacket.<br /><br />The \"special features\" stank too. \"Making of Black Dawn\" can be summed up as \"let's show the main characters filming the helicopter sequence\" and Tamara Davies laments that she finds it hard to feel tension when she's sitting in a fake helicopter on the set. Somehow I'm not surprised. And the best she can say about director Gruszynski is that he is \"convenient\".<br /><br />The \"Interview with Steven Seagal\" contained some flashed scenes which would have been better off in the \"Making of\" title. The rest of it wasn't an interview. There was no interviewer, there were no questions. It was Steven Seagal rambling. It sort of devolved into various pictures of Seagal doing humanitarian work in the 3rd world. I'm not quite sure why.<br /><br />Five trailers on the DVD showed 5 Sony movies which, if truth be told, looked much better than this rubbish. Some were Seagal movies, some were Wesley Snipes.<br /><br />This movie isn't worth buying; isn't worth renting either. Seagal should lose some weight and train up before acting again, if he wishes to be the star of an action picture.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 12319, "text": "The first sequel of a film like this A Nightmare on Elm Street is probably the most difficult task, especially if you change directors. It has to be in the line of the first film and yet change a few things to make it nothing but a repeat. The character of Freddy Krueger is kept with his three distinctive elements : the right hand four finger claws, the hat and the black and red striped pullover, plus of course his ugly mug. But then we move. First the main character is a boy something like a junior or senior in high school, so not really a boy anymore. But yet the boyish side is emphasized by a hairless body, shiny and pure skin, a skin that is widely shown and slowly brushed up and down by the camera. And that's the change. The camera really centers on his body, his skin, his flesh even, except of course his front sexual parts per se. Then it uses gym scenes and even locker room and shower scenes, but once again with restraint. Very little nudity and when there is some backside scenes it is in a very traumatic situation : the gay sports teacher who is tortured and whipped in the nude of course, tied up to the showers, while the boy in the nude too is shown slightly in some darkness and flittingly. Many scenes of the boy in bed only wearing his underwear, never really ambiguous but always sexy even if once again flittingly. Then some more elements are added : his friendship with another boy who is the rather of the macho type but who does not seem afraid of a masculine friendship. Both are victimized by the gay sports teacher on the football field a couple of times and in the end the boy, Jesse, will come to ask for help from his friend, Grady, and the first reaction will be nearly openly gay even if denied in some side remark, and Freddy will kill Grady through, from inside the body of Jesse : if that is not a repressed homosexual desire, what is ? And before Jesse had gone to a leather bar and had been literally kidnapped by the gay sports teacher and it is then later in the showers that Freddy again will kill this openly gay character from within the body of Jesse. If one case is a coincidence, two are not and that is the main change of this film from a girl-centered vision of fear to a boy-centered vision. In fact we must understand that Freddy is the real character questioned here. He is an old pedophile and after having recaptured some existence through the dream of a girl in the first film, and having thus gotten a couple of boys in his bag through the desire of the girl for these boys, now he moves directly to the main target of his desire : he wants to possess a boy from inside, he is a gay pedophile and Jesse, to defend his sanity in this invasion, will have to react against this gayness that is imposed onto him and kill the boys and men Freddy desires. But this can also be nothing but a tactic from Freddy to push Jesse into killing, to titillate him where it tickles and where Jesse does not really want to be tickled, though when Freddy forces Jesse away from his girlfriend at the very moment when he was getting excited enough to let himself slip into some sex can be seen as the revulsion of Freddy for that type of sex or as the fear of Jesse in front of that type of sex, which would lead to believing that Freddy managed to get back into existence through the homosexual desire of Jesse and at the same time his resistance to this sexual appeal. But that is a real change in that kind of horror films : to take a point of view that focuses onto a boy, his desires, his fears, and his anxiety, all of it emphasized by a castrating authoritarian father and a loving, maybe too much, mother. We must keep in mind that this is a common situation for many boys when they turn sixteen or seventeen. In no way is this sequel lower and less intense than the first episode. Note finally the use of an old abandoned factory to give some density to Freddy's old personality and past, but also to open another chapter in that exploration of fear : the fear we can feel in front of and inside those old factories that seem in many ways haunted. That is a dimension Stephen King has used over and over again in so many of his books and films. Nothing really new but something definitely effective, at least by reminding the audience of other frightening scenes in other films. Then the evaluation of that reference is a question of date to know who used it first and who is a copycat or an imitator, who can anyway also be a developer.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 37710, "text": "I rarely write online reviews, but after reading most of the comments here my fingers couldn't type fast enough. Clearly, the majority of reviewers here saw a different film than the one I did. A masterpiece? Artful? Brilliant? Either that, or they just have poor taste in films. I still have no interest in really reviewing this film, but let me clear up a few erroneous statements from previous reviews: <br /><br />1) Please don't trash James Whale's 1931 film unless you've actually SEEN it  all of it, because it's a far superior film to this, bolts and all. Whale may have changed the story quite a bit, but he captured the spirit of the novel and created one of the greatest cinematic icons of all time. (And Boris Karloff played the monster, not Lon Chaney).<br /><br />2) Although this film is truer to the original novel, it is not faithful and makes considerable changes that alter the overall intent of the story. There is no love triangle in the book, Victor Frankenstein is a medical student of about 18-19 years of age (Branagh is well past the sell-by date for that), and he creates the monster entirely by accident. (No drama whatsoever in the book - he wakes up with the creature hovering near his bed. No electricity, no solar panels as in \"The True Story\", no amniotic fluid as in this film).<br /><br />3) De Niro is laughable as the creature. He's completely out of his element and hopelessly miscast. As for make-up, Karloff is closer to original story (minus the bolts). In the novel the creature has weepy yellow eyes, skin like a cadaver, and is nine feet tall. Karloff's make-up was green because when filmed under proper lighting (on B&W film) green make-up looks deadly pale, almost pure white, not because the monster in that film was supposed to be green. Again, it's B&W folks! <br /><br />This story will always present challenges for a filmmaker because it's not really horrific as a story by our standards, or by the standards of the 1930s for that matter, hence the bolts. It's was a novel of the Romantic Era, and the very premise was frightening in and of itself.<br /><br />The real core of the novel is the on-going philosophical debate between young Victor, and his bastard child - the creature. Yes, it's a novel about creating life and playing God, but underneath that is a novel about both adolescent sexuality  Young Victor, alone in his attic, fooling around with nature  and also the consequences of creating a life and then not taking responsibility for it. Branagh's film is too caught up in hammy acting and nauseating camera moves to ever really get there. Yes, the debates are there, but the soul isn't. It's a vaudeville sideshow masquerading as art. For those with only a passing knowledge of the book, it may seem truer, but Whale's 1931 film is actually much closer to the novel's heart in its depiction of \"the other\", the outcast, the bastard than this ever comes close to.", "sentiment": 0}

First a flashback of events from the Hobbit, followed by events from Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers. The story picks up during Sam's rescue of Frodo from the tower. We are treated to the Battle of Gondor, Frodo & Sam's trip to Mount Doom (through the lands of Mordor) and the Battle at the Black Gate.<br /><br />This movie is mostly a patchwork of elements from the novel. There are some good voice talents being used. First and foremost is John Huston as Gandalf (and the narrator). One can also recognize Roddy McDowall as the voice of Samwise Gamgee. The voice of Gollum is also memorably done by Brother Theodore. These three characterizations (and voices) along with the music is what makes this movie truly memorable. The music is just so wonderful. I fondly remember my childhood watching this movie, in syndication on television during the mid to late 80's, and being simply captivated.

Van Cleef and Marley and their gang kill his father and kill and rape his mother and sister Glynis O'Connor stows away on their outlaw wagon. Talk about not too much smarts.<br /><br />Anyway young Leif is out for blood, but the most androgynous teen idol until Michael Jackson never really makes you feel he's all that bloodthirsty. Garrett also meets Jim Brown, a miner who the outlaws have robbed and left tied up and stretched out to die. Garrett comes him free and the two of them join forces to get the gang that did them dirt.<br /><br />The climax which I can't reveal is hokey beyond belief, the most unbelievable western showdown ever filmed. This film just might have killed the Israeli western business more than the Arabs.", "sentiment": 0}

Why anyone would want to submit himself to an over-clichéd chick flick that looks and acts like something we've all seen a million times before - only worse - is beyond me. Still, awareness seems to be sky high, with many unwilling boyfriends/husbands destined to be dragged to their local theaters by their mates.<br /><br />At a time where quality films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire are actually making a dent at the box-office, Bride Wars existence baffles me. The story follows two BFF (best friends forever) who decided to have a wedding in June at some fancy plaza when they were little girls. Years later, an unfortunate series of events ends in both the women - still BFF well into their twenties (like duh) - setting their wedding day on the exact same date. From here on out, it's war between the two stereotypical women (one control-freaked blonde, otherwise known as Kate Hudson; and one spineless brunette, known better as Anne Hathaway). Naturally, both ladies live in a perfect world where there's no economic depression and they can each spend an enormous amount of money on this unnecessary war of theirs. <br /><br />Alas, instead of being a decent display of romantic comedy, Bride Wars becomes a shallow and degrading show that implies that with all the progress the feminist movement has made during the past century, women will always be emotional and helpless beings, forever interested in superficial matters. In a time when women aim to run for Presidency and lead social revolutions, this is a real depressing conclusion.

{"id": 30694, "text": "This is one of the best, and underrated, westerns ever made. It was a very intense, interesting character study of a famous lawman, showing flaws and all. In fact, this is the only version, I believe, that really shows the sadistic side of Wyatt Earp, and what made him a bitter man. To be fair, it also shows his good traits. <br /><br />It also has a terrific, deep cast and features a good mix of drama, romance and action. Even the music grows on you after several viewings. There is no humor in here: this is a serious story. Unlike the more popular \"Tombstone,\" this Earp story has a lot less profanity and almost no usage of the Lord's name in vain....but there is rough language and some crude sexual remarks, so don't watch it with the kiddies.<br /><br />At rate, the movie is a lot better than the critics would have you believe. (All nationally-known critics but one panned this, as far as I know.)<br /><br />Kevin Costner performed one of his better acting jobs. It was nice to see Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore as good guys. That's not seen in too many films! They were low-key characters, too. Dennis Quaid did a nice job as the fascinating \"Doc Holliday.\" It's generally conceded that Val Kilmer's \"Doc\" in \"Tombstone\" was the best-ever, but Quaid version is just fine, thank you, and gets better and better with each viewing. <br /><br />This is a long movie, but it's never dull and it never overdoes the action, either.

Stevenson novella - opting, instead, to indiscriminately incorporate elements of lycanthropy and vampirism which make no sense at all...but which lend the film value as a unique curio and one which, in view of its sheer audacity, it is difficult to hate (indeed, the whole misguided enterprise reminded me of the contemporaneous FRANKENSTEIN 1970 [1958])! <br /><br />Despite the ultra-cheap production, the film makes the most of its foggy atmosphere and the hallucination sequences are effective in a naïve sort of way.

The end sequence looks like the best in the game and I own Final Fantasy IX and I am half way throgh disc one of four and I have found this one of the more boring games the FMV's are even better than this game but there is no story.<br /><br />Squall reminds you of Cloud and Rinoa reminds you of Aeris because of the way they are to each other and you can tell that they are desined to be together. I think that Seplhie and Irvine should end up together and that Seifer and Quistis should end up together and then Zell could end up with the girl that like him from the library which is a side storyline which is good and gives you the chance to get to know more about the characters and what they like.<br /><br />Another good scene is the dance after Squall passes his final exam to get into SEED. He dances with Rinoa and is terrible until he looks into her eyes which is quite sweet. The look she gives one couple who bump into them when they dance is funny.<br /><br />Laguna and Raine have a very short but sweet relationship and you feel sorry for him in the end sequence because he still misses her a lot and they were married and are the parents of Squall.<br /><br />So to sum up Final Fantasy VII and VIII are by far the best RPG games ever made and they beat each other in different ways this game wins by FMV sequences and the love story that ends happy unlike Cloud and Aeris. The ending is the one of the best parts of the game and quite long and you feel sorry for Squall when you see him cry and Rinoa cries when she sees him. But the very last scene of the game sees the two of them finally sharing a loving kiss and you get to see Seifer laugh and Edea happy with Cid and the rest of the gang having a laugh with each other and Zell stuffing his face full of food and ends up choking and having to be saved by Selphie and Quistis.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 37755, "text": "Fist of the North Star starts with a lengthy, & boring, narration by a guy named Ryuken (Malcolm McDowell). The opening shot is of a desolate post-apocalyptic world with what were once our cities but are now crumbling ruins, a lawless world where acid rain falls from the sky & the strong prey on the weak. Ryuken talks of a school of martial arts named the Southern Cross, the flag of the Southern Cross is now the fearful symbol of a new order. The North Star is the last opposing school, basically the Southern Cross is evil & the North Star is good. The Southern Cross Master, Lord Shin (Costas Mandylor) executes the Master of the North Star, Ryuken. Lord Shin also tires to kill Ryuken's son, Kenshiro (Gary Daniels). Lord Shin leaves Kenshiro for dead in the wastelands & takes his lover Julia (Isako Washio) as his own to Southern Cross City which he rules. However, Kenshiro is not dead & sets about finding Lord Shin & putting a end to his evil plans to 'liberate the wastelands' by any means necessary. About 200 miles North of Southern Cross City is a small town called Paradise Valley where they protect their most precious commodity, water. Lord Shin wants this water & sends his deformed henchmen & their gangs out to destroy Paradise Valley & take the water lead by head bad guy known as the Jackal (Chris Penn). Kenshiro runs into a teenager named Bat (Dante Basco) & a young blind girl named Lynn (Nalona Herron) who he magically cures. Since they both have a common problem in the shape of Lord Shin & his men they sort of join forces to defeat him, after some silly plot devices keep throwing them together. I guess that's just about it, Kenshiro eventually meets up with Lord Shin & after some personal angst over Shin kidnapping Julia & murdering his Father they have a fight & that's about that.<br /><br />Co-written & directed by by Tony Randel based on the Japanese comic & anime Hokuto No Ken by Buronson & Tetsuo Hara I thought this live-action version of Fist of the North Star had a lot potential which it ultimately didn't deliver. The script by Randel & Peter Atkins ditches the over-the-top violence & comic book feel. The film seems to take itself a little too seriously & as a result ends up being a bit dull. There are a couple of scenes which try to recreate the comic book feel like when Kenshiro kicks someones face & dislocates his jaw to an amazing extent or in the same sequence where he punches someone in the back & a big bulge appears on their chest from the force. Unfortunately these are about the only scenes worth mentioning in this regard as the rest of the fights are short, dull, unimaginative & few & far between. Towards the end Kenshiro has to fight lots of Lord Shin's guards, he literally punches or kicks them once & they're defeated, Kenshiro's climactic fight with Lord Shin was also a let down. Fist of the North Star really needed lots more blood, gore, violence & energy in it's disappointing fight scenes. Having said that the fights are reasonably well choreographed & aren't any worse than any other low budget martial arts film. The story is simple to say the least, large chunks of it are annoyingly told in monologues & flashbacks by various characters. The characters were annoying thinly sketched bland stereotypes. It also could have done with losing a few minutes worth of running time as it drags a little in places. The cast features some familiar faces, Malcolm McDowell is in it for about three minutes maximum even though he gets near top-billing in the credits, Chris Penn makes for a sleazy bad guy & is criminally wasted throughout, Costas Mandylor didn't convince me as the most evil man on Earth, Clint Howard makes an appearance as Stalin one of Lord Shin's henchmen, Melvin Van Peebles was here somewhere but I don't know who he played & as for leading man Gary Daniels he is about as wooden & unconvincing as I expected. The music by Christopher L. Stone is totally inappropriate as it's very quiet & orchestral, this film needed an upbeat fast score to compliment the action scenes & at least try to get the blood pumping a little. The one thing where Fist of the North Star gains a few points is it's production values & design, it's actually rather impressive. The wastelands, Paradise Valley & Southern Cross City all look very convincing considering the budget as do the costumes & the overall look of Fist of the North Star. There isn't much blood or gore & disappointingly not a single on screen exploding head even though Chris Penn's head almost explodes but unfortunately the scene cuts away just at the vital moment, there is a cool looking zombie though who's in it for a couple of minutes & a few blood spraying wounds. Overall Fist of the Nortrh Star is a reasonable film, there's nothing greatly wrong with it as it's generally well made & tells it's story competently enough but I can't help but feel disappointed at what it could have been had it been made by a stronger director who had the guts to go with what made the original Japanese comic so good. Average at best, worth watching if you've got nothing better to do.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 22425, "text": "This is one surefire case where the unavailability of a film (even if I did catch it, on local TV of all places, in the mid-1980s) turns it into a cult which is ultimately undeserving! Incidentally, I know first-hand about its 'banning' from the U.S. following a lawsuit by Universal for plagiarizing the first two entries in the JAWS series  having heard director Castellari boasting about the fact (even going so far as to contend that the real reason behind the film being pulled from theaters was that its profit ratio exceeded that originally made by Universal) at a press conference during the 2004 Venice Film Festival! <br /><br />If anything, Castellari's career has shown him to be a shrewd if erratic film-maker who was not only generally content to go with the flow rather than make his own thing so to speak but, on a number of occasions, he cannibalized elements which had been successful in previous films by shamelessly including them in his own (notably Woody Strode's bow-and-arrow expert from THE PROFESSIONALS [1966] being incorporated into Castellari's admittedly impressive KEOMA [1976]). Interestingly, he even saw fit to steal from himself  since JONATHAN OF THE BEARS (1993) bears {sic} more than a cursory nod to the latter; another thing he was prone to doing was reviving popular mythical figures, such as the disastrous SINBAD OF THE SEVEN SEAS (1989) and the TV mini-series THE RETURN OF SANDOKAN (1996; which I recently acquired but have yet to check out)  though, in all fairness, he did muster a fairly successful re-imagining of Homer's \"The Illiad\" in gangland terms with the little-known spoof HECTOR THE MIGHTY (1971).<br /><br />However, there's little to say about the crass commercial thinking that went into the making of THE LAST SHARK (by the way, Castellari had already made the even sillier THE SHARK HUNTER [1979]); the greatest insult, though, is that the film-makers couldn't hope to raise the budget (most likely, they didn't even have the inclination!) to attempt a product on the same level as JAWS 2 (1978), let alone the classic original  which is why the thing smacks of blatant rip-off, pure and simple!! Given a lean 88-minute running-time, it's no surprise the plot is so thin and obvious (virtually recreating all the highlights from the first two Universal shark flicks  however, while characterization was a strong element, in JAWS at least, the scriptwriters here lazily resort to mere stereotypes). Worse, the film repeats a good many of its incidents and effects twice or more: the idiotic 'explosion' when the shark attacks from below; the heroine  played by the director's own lovely daughter  falling into the sea, where she's not so lucky the second time around; the dives by would-be expert shark-fighter Vic Morrow  complete with heavy Irish brogue a' la Robert Shaw's Quint from the first JAWS  to destroy the creature both fail miserably, the second time getting tangled up in ropes and being dragged Ahab-like by the shark; characters get bitten in halfto say nothing of the ultra-fake blue-eyed[!] shark's head emerging open-mouthed out of the water and always hilariously tilted at the same angle. What about the sheer excess of stock footage, then (with the shark changing dimension and look from one scene to the next)?; some of these were genuinely unsettling, to be sure  but, while this practice may be forgiven when viewed in excessively dark prints (as some online reviewers have complained), it wasn't in the surprisingly clean edition that I came across only recently <br /><br />James Franciscus has the lead role here; for the record, he had played a villain in another Italian JAWS rip-off  or, more specifically, PIRANHA (1978)  i.e. Antonio Margheriti's KILLER FISH (1979; which is one I'd also love to get a second opinion of after all these years). Another standard character is the oily aspiring Governor who, all of a sudden, decides to hunt the monster by himself in his helicopter in what emerges as the film's undeniable highlight of absurdity  he throws huge chunks of meat into the sea to entice it, but we're never sure just what he'll do once the shark turns up (needless to say, we're not allowed to find out as both the man and his vehicle tumble to the sea before long). Also on hand are a TV crew who are always trying to get the best shot of the sharkuntil the latter personally intervenes to this end and brings down the whole pier into the sea! Mind you, the film is hugely enjoyable while it's on (albeit unintentionally so for the most part)  right down from the very opening scene, accompanied by the cheesiest song imaginable, of a surfer trying out some impossibly intricate moves until the shark takes a bite out of his board.<br /><br />It's ironic, then, that this movie was itself ripped off by the makers of both JAWS 3-D (1983) and JAWS: THE REVENGE (1987), the vastly inferior concluding episodes in the Universal saga: as in the latter, the shark is depicted as an intelligent animal (such as when it systematically pursues the entire line-up of surfers without killing them only to then vent its anger on the man leading them in a boat and, again, when it tries to bury our two heroes inside a cave by crashing repeatedly into a rock-face and barring its exit with the falling stones!)while the explosive ending was replicated wholesale into the official third JAWS entry (THE LAST SHARK was actually released as part of the series in Spain!). At this point, I should mention that the scenes at sea were partly filmed in Malta; normally, I ought to be proud of that fact  but I guess that only a country with no cinema industry of its own could be duped into believing that this is how a professional monster flick is made!!", "sentiment": 0}

I was excited about this all last year because it was a collection of B-movies star to make you proud. Don Wilson, Cynthia (Jubblies! I like the Jubblies!) Rothrock and Lorenzo Lamas. Unfortunately it ended up being standard Don fare with a ludicrous plot about a virtual reality fighting game that goes haywire and in essence is an excuse for loads of fights. The fights are very routinely done and Don Wilson continues his annoying trend of pulling his punches and forcing out the choreogrpahy slowly and without timing. I have never seen him look lightening quick in a film. Granted I have not seen all his movies but for a legendary kick boxer her certainly looks like he can't fight when it comes to his movies. Dan Mayid, who plays his son in this film puts him to shame and looks like he could have a bright future as an action star, he is certainly a better actor than his mentor. Mayid was interestingly enough cast at a marital arts convention. He is a big fan of Don, he showed him a few moves and they cast him as his son. Great stuff.<br /><br />Problems in this film arise because there are loads of fights and most are from Don, while Mayid and the other leads have a lot less to do. Rothrock has one fight which is good and she still kicks but like the best of them, whilst showing her ample jubilee off in a cleavage boosting low cut dress. Lorenzo has a brief bit but he is essentially a cameo part, which is a shame because he is the best actor of the lot, by far. I'd have preferred him in the lead because he fights better than Don. The film is still reasonably fun though because it is so cheesy and they have some clichéd and hokey drama in it that is so badly done you can't help but laugh.<br /><br />The film also features a score from Vince DiCola responsible for two scores I loved in the 80's in Transformers and Rocky 4, however this is not 80's style and his score is mostly generic, aside from some moments that have the Vince pazzazz. Overall this film has great curiosity value but for those expecting something great, you'll be disappointed. It was a fairly ambitious idea for a Don film but is letdown by poor execution on most parts. Only Rothrocks boobies and the potential of Mayid (An amazing athlete, and young enough to develop into at least an acceptable actor)make this worthwhile but that's about it. **", "sentiment": 0}

The acting was extremely good, and the writing and plot is very imaginative and original...which is a nice change of pace compared to the many \"copycat\" movies that abound. The sets were very authentic and the outdoor settings quite spectacular.<br /><br />The SFX/CGI was quite good; on a scale of 1-10 I'd give the EFX a solid 8; not the best I have seen, but very much above average.<br /><br />All-in-all, The Water Hores is a movie that is definitely a suggested viewing for those looking for something a little different and fun.", "sentiment": 0}

When I saw the movie for the first time I was 14 and I was really astonished how she could make me identify with Mary Lennox, a 10-year-old girl from the beginning at the century, in a story line no one would give a damn about in our days. It has been an experience of its own since. Now I'm 18 and probably more cynical, so it has lost some of its magic to me, but I still like to try to get enchanted and I would urge everyone to ... well ... open his mind. It's a children's movie alright, but more important it is just perfectly done!<br /><br />Mrs. Medlock, Mary Lennox's adversary, if you want so, is played by the excellent Maggie Smith. She rules the castle of Mary's tragic uncle, where she has to live. As if the castle weren't already a very eerie and uncomfortable place (you feel it), under her orders it becomes some kind of nuthouse as she's jerking around everybody - giving the movie very funny and very weird moments. It's unfair how she treats Mary and just plain crazy what she does to Colin, Mary's cousin. But she's not really evil, not a villainess, but she'll show us that she has a heart. I appreciate this attitude very much: how people are never really evil, only a bit sickened.<br /><br />All characters and actors are really fine, but I want to lose a few more words about Mary Lennox. It's an extremely well-written character for a child and this allows Kate Maberly to carry the movie, make us want to accompany her. Originally, she actually is *egotistic*, but maybe only thus she can find her way and make things right. You'll find her cheeky, you'll like her and you'll understand her.<br /><br />There is much more to say about the picturesque garden, music, friendships, attitudes and so forth...

I rewatched it though and was surprised and how much better I liked it this time. Perhaps due to lower expectations. Anyway, on the the \"sequel.\"<br /><br />Only 1 character from Mimic is here, Miro Sorvino's partner Remy. In Mimic she disappears about half way through, her job in the plot done. Here she carries the movie and does a decent job of taking her 10 minutes of screen time in the first film and giving her more here. Her use of her camera here is a nice continuity touch. Other characters are generally disposable (and nearly all of them are disposed of).<br /><br />No creative people return and yet the style and tone are very reminscent of the first film. The plot is mostly rehash of the first movie with a group of people trapped in a confined space with human sized mutant cockroaches. Of course, the style and look of the first film were mostly borrowed from Species and the Alien series (particularly Alien 3) so this one follows suit.<br /><br />This time, an undeveloped plot about the military (basically replacing the CDC of the first film) is introduced but not fleshed out. Given the film's extra short 82 minute run time, more certainly could have been added. This almost seemed more like an unused idea for the first film rather than a seperate plot line of it's own.<br /><br />The science here is weak (and accounts for the one glaring continuity error when Remy explains what DNA went into the Judas breed) but the plot doesn't hinge on science. It's a giant bug movie. My expectations of credible science are minimal.<br /><br />None of the characters behave in the typical ultra-stupid \"I'm in a horror movie so I'm not gonna scream for help but instead hide until I get eaten\" manner which helps.

Houghton's Hispanic maid warns her that Dallesandro might be a witch - or warlock for you perfectionists out there - but she believes her maid to be crazy.

The visualisation of psychological dread inevitably compromises the impact experienced when reading the stories, where we are allowed the slow build-up of anticipation and fear. And this is the main problem with this production. It is slow all right but totally lacking in suspense. Part of the problem is that we see right from the start that the penalty for disturbing the buried crown of Anglia is death, and the rest of the film merely plays out exactly the same pattern, as Peter Vaughan searches for and finds the crown, is pursued by a ghost and dies in exactly the same way. This comes as no surprise at all, and is ponderously done to boot. The Norfolk setting is eerily desolate for sure, but the inclusion of an artist (why is this significant?) and creepy landlord merely divert our attention away from the dramatic focus which is obviously being played out in Vaughan's imagination. To this extent we are excluded from the heart of the fear explored in James' writings and one can only conclude, I'm afraid, that trying to film such a tale was a mistake at worst, or needed a more inventive approach at best.", "sentiment": 0}

I mean, for I can see, he started it all. Currently, I have 4 Harryhausen monster flicks. \"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\", \"Clash of the Titans\", and two Sinbad films, \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\" and \"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\".<br /><br />\"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger\" is a weaker entry in the many movies having Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, but it contains one of the most elaborate collection of fantasy monsters. Well, we get to see a group of bug-eyed ghouls, a near-human baboon (which is actually a cursed prince), a bronze Minaton (also known as Minatour in mythology), a large bee, a gigantic Walrus (one of my favorite of the batch), a club-wielding Troglodyte and a saber-toothed tiger. All pretty well done.<br /><br />But lets go to the bad things about this movie. Well, the story's fine, but the script is lacking and the acting is fair. Patrick Wayne lacks the makings of a great Sinbad.

There the three learn that they are fighters for this out break and that also they might be part of what happened.

His brother Charlie (Luke Ford) has severe Autism and Attention Deficit Disorder. He's not able to speak and because he's the size of an adult, caring for him is not easy. At the start of the film we see him grunt with delight as he tramples a newly-bought carton of eggs into the kitchen floor.<br /><br />While Thomas's mother (Toni Collette) has accepted her son's condition, Thomas has not. He wants to keep his brother a secret from his new schoolmates but when one student (Gemma Ward) learns of his sibling, she's not put off.<br /><br />It's been a number of years since I've connected with an Australian film to the extent that I did with THE BLACK BALLOON. From the interesting title sequence at the start, we're drawn into the challenges of life with a family member suffering a developmental disability. While, I suppose, an outsider could never fully appreciate just how demanding such a life could be, the film gives us a very good idea.<br /><br />One of the film's many accomplishments is its successful blend of drama and comedy. It could quite easily have been a depressing affair but many of the brother's outrageous acts prove most amusing. On other occasions, they're heartbreaking.<br /><br />Equally fine is the performance by Luke Ford. Playing a handicapped character is a challenge for any actor, but Ford is totally convincing as Charlie. Never do we consider he's an actor playing a role. <br /><br />Toni Collette is first-rate as the ever-loving mother. She's heavily pregnant and when complications arise from her pregnancy, we can't help but wonder if the third child will be like Thomas or Charlie.<br /><br />The most likable of the characters is Thomas's classmate and later girlfriend, Jackie, played by Gemma Ward. Her acceptance of Charlie and her solid support for Thomas makes her most appealing. It's interesting to note that while Thomas sees Charlie as a burden, his formal introduction to Jackie and the development of their relationship has much to do with his brother.<br /><br />THE BLACK BALLOON is the work of first-time director Elissa Down, who studied film-making in Perth. She has done a sterling job. Having grown up with two Autistic brothers, it must be a profoundly personal work. The screenplay, by Down and Jimmy the Exploder, is honest and moving and the photography by Denson Baker is fine. I particularly appreciated his low- angle wide shots.<br /><br />THE BLACK BALLOON won the Crystal Bear at this year's Berlin Film Festival. It's an important film and deserves to be seen. The Australian Film Industry, sadly, does not have a good reputation, at home or overseas. But if we make films like this one, that's sure to change.", "sentiment": 0}

There were so many little sub- scenes that were out of character with most of the episodes that followed. For example, when Yeoman Rand brings lunch to Mr. Sulu, or when Capt. Kirk is eating a snack while on the bridge conducting a search, or when Uhuru is trying to make small-talk with Mr. Spock while he's at the helm. This was all great for character development, but I really missed this type of \"not part of the plot\" interplay in the episodes that followed.

I saw this the first day it was out and I guess it almost lived up to my expectations. Bruce Willis portrays Jack Mosley, a alcoholic cop who, after a long day of work, has to escort a prisoner to a trial for a testimony. Mos Def plays Eddie Bunker, the prisoner with a dream of becoming a baker. They have to go 16 blocks in a little bit over a hour. They encounter multiple attempts on Eddie's life, and Mosley begins to suspect other cops of this. 16 Blocks is an intense thrill ride with multiple twists. Great camera angles that create more suspense help you really understand what they are going through. David Morse did a great job playing the dirty cop. The only problem is that it has some parts that would make you laugh. This may take away the seriousness of the movie from some viewers.

{"id": 7246, "text": "I've been a fan of Laurel and Hardy all my life, but there came a point in their movie career where their distinct style of humor simply ceased to be. In their earlier films, you had Stan with his endless Malaprops, prompting Ollie's looks of disgust into the camera; the physical comedy was brilliant, and often led off by the duo selecting the most illogical and idiotic course of action possible for the bizarre circumstances in which they found themselves.<br /><br />Example: You are delivering a piano. The door of the house is locked but you can get in through an upstairs balcony door. Do you put one person in through that door, then have him come downstairs and open the main door for you to bring in the piano? No, you try to bring the piano in through the upstairs door, using a flimsy canopy as a mounting point for a block and tackle hoist! That is just an example of the kind of humor which made Stan and Ollie famous.<br /><br />Well, all that seems to be gone in this movie. I got halfway through watching \"Great Guns\" and realized I had wasted as much time as I had spent watching it to that point - and I turned it off. (If I have to watch more than half-way through a movie to get past the part that is an utter waste, it's too far gone to redeem itself for me.) While Stan and Ollie still looked much like their old selves in this film, it's like they were almost afraid to be those two zany characters from their GOOD movies, like they didn't feel like they could pull it off... like maybe they didn't believe in themselves anymore? Laurel and Hardy had a period in which they made brilliant comedies, where you couldn't help laughing out loud at the sheer lunacy of their antics and the disasters which resulted. Like Stan trying to move a dump truck so Ollie could get his wife's new convertible out of its parking space, and Stan works the lever that makes the dump truck unload tons of dirt onto the car. Or Stan visiting Ollie in the hospital and sitting on a hypodermic needle full of tranquilizer, and Ollie ending up hanging out the window by his cast-wrapped leg. Those were Laurel and Hardy films which made them popular and famous, deservedly so. This movie, Great Guns, is all talk talk talk, most of that not very funny, and little else. Yawn. I'm a big L&H fan but I know I will never bother watching this film ever again. Phew! It's a sad movie, not a comedy. It's simply not very funny, and very little like the earlier films they'd made.", "sentiment": 0}

I can watch a Mooninite centered episode of ATHF, laugh my ass off and walk away from the television feeling pretty good about myself. On the other hand, if I watch something like South Park, I'll laugh quite a bit, but after it's over, it leaves me feeling a tiny bit blah.

Other than the same jokes being repeated show after show after show, the plot is pretty much being driven by Orel's stupidity. 10% clever premise filled in with 90% filler.<br /><br />The one thing I will say is consistently good about the show is the animation.

{"id": 5130, "text": "This remarkable trio of spooky stories served as a pilot to the not-quite-so remarkable TV series of the same name, though now it is just as likely remembered as the point where two screen legends passed at opposite trajectories of their careers. Steven Spielberg's first professional directing job was segment two of this anthology, which also proved to be one of Joan Crawford's last acting efforts, certainly her last worth noting.<br /><br />Conceived by another legend, the brilliant Rod Serling, the concept of the film and subsequent series was meant to be a variation on his classic \"Twilight Zone\" series, varying tales of supernatural horror, each tied to a grotesque painting and each introduced by Serling, acting as the gallery's curator. It was an excellent start, though the resulting series proved to be a pale imitation of \"The Twilight Zone,\" a peculiar hodgepodge of styles and concepts, some classics and some just plain silly.<br /><br />The TV movie itself stands alone, though the trio of tales unfold in descending order. The first and best is \"The Cemetery,\" a variation on the classic ghost story. In this southern Gothic creeper, Roddy McDowall murders his wealthy uncle, but finds that enjoying his newfound inheritance is a bit difficult since a painting on the wall seems to suggest that Uncle is buried, but not dead. The story is slight, even silly, but boy, oh boy, does Roddy know how to chew the scenery. I can think of no other actor who so obviously loved to act more than McDowall and here he plays evil to the hilt. Roddy was undoubtedly one of the most intrinsically likable stars there ever was, so much so that he could play the most despicably evil characters and still make the character a delight. \"The Cemetery\" is nicely written by Serling and tightly directed by Boris Segal, but it is Roddy's one-man show.<br /><br />But if Roddy McDowall could make loathsome characters inexplicably likable, than Joan Crawford had the knack for negating any trace of sympathy that her characters might possess. In Spielberg's \"Eyes,\" Joan plays a ruthless millionairess who happens to be blind, but has the chance to briefly see again by buying the eyes of a living person who is in desperate need of money. It is a nice performance; hard and demanding, Crawford never asks for pity, but nevertheless earns it with the story's nifty twist ending. More a clever idea than a solid story, the tale is not particularly suspenseful; bit it does displays a cool sense of cynical irony. And never is it apparent that it is Spielberg's first crack at professional film-making, so sure is his use of the camera and setting of mood.<br /><br />The third tale of the trilogy, \"Escape Route,\" is probably the most like the classic \"Twilight Zone,\" dark and brooding; yet least successful as a thriller. Richard Kiley is a war criminal who thinks he can escape his past by literally throwing himself into art. Rod Serling has other ideas. As the trilogy's closing act, I guess it was suppose to be the one with the most impact, the one to show off Serling's penchant for moralizing. It doesn't quite come off. I think part of the problem is that Kiley, a good actor, lacks a powerful screen presence. The best episodes of \"Night Gallery,\" and for that matter \"The Twilight Zone,\" featured actors with strong personalities who were not only talented, but adept at pushing their performances to the edge, flirting with going over the top, just as McDowall and Crawford do. Any short form fiction, be it on the page or on the screen, needs that heightened sense of drama, that admission that reality has been left behind.<br /><br />Though it had some strong episodes at first, the \"Night Gallery\" TV series fell out of Serling's control and eventually became sort of a ghost story version of \"Love, American Style,\" a crude mix of cheap jokes and heavy-handed suspense. It's a pity that it didn't stay true to this pilot; it could have been another \"Twilight Zone.\"", "sentiment": 0}

The third, with Pier Angeli and Kirk Douglas was a treat even for a viewer who does not usually like Kirk Douglas. It rates a 9 on the basis of the marvelous sequences as he teaches Pier Angeli the art of high wire performance. But it is the first, which deserves 11 out of 10, which makes this film a \"must see.\" I know of no other film in which great orchestral music has been treated with such respect and insight. There are long, uninterrupted sequences of the marvelous Moira Shearer dancing to one of Rachmaninoff's fabulous Variations on a Theme of Paganini. The combination is superlative ballet, and superlative interpretation of a great orchestral work of the late romantic school. As icing on the cake, James Mason is the audience of one as she dances, an irascible impresario who is, quite understandably, overwhelmed by the magic of Shearer's performance. The story ends too soon. At full length, with three times the dancing, and a better love story between Shearer and Mason, it would be a movie I might expect to see in Heaven.

{"id": 23425, "text": "The film reminds me of two other films: Marty, a low-budget independent romance that won the Best Picture Oscar in 1955 and Big Night, which focuses on the close relationship between two very different brothers. Made on a $40, 000 budget, this film won the Best First Film award at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film does not have a very original story and is fairly predictable but that is okay because it is not really plot-driven. Just like a Chopin Prelude played by many different pianists: the notes are the same and predictable but the overall effect can vary from terrible to sublime. This film approaches the sublime. It is about characters who can win our hearts very easily. There are five central characters: two brothers of very different temperament, their new girlfriends and an elderly black widower, all quite lovable. The brothers are in their twenties and have social problems that they must deal with. The plot starts weak but grows strong, as the brothers start to overcome their current problems but end up with new ones. The brothers are very close and positive with each other, in a most delightful way; each one helps the other just by being there. They are played by real-life brothers, who also co-wrote the screenplay with their close friend, the director. The older brother is overly serious and ambitious: \"Goat on Fire\". He is befriended by a wise, elderly, black co-worker, who is pining for his late wife. The younger brother is a personable fellow, who just glides through life: \"Smiling Fish\". Since the older brother brought up his younger brother, they having been orphaned, he is unable to look to his younger brother for direction but the old man is extremely wise, helpful and loving and becomes a father-figure for the older brother and a delight for the audience.

{"id": 36384, "text": "I didn't expect much of anything other than a few memorable kills and maybe a cheap jump scare here and there. This pathetic excuse for a movie couldn't even deliver that much. For starters, I personally can't stand how recent horror movies are shot. Everything has the same dark, muddy and flat-looking quality, with no real clarity of picture and irritating shakycam going into overdrive during 90 percent of the horror/action scenes because far too many directors today aren't talented enough to stage an effective horror or action scene without it. The gore was often even hard to make out because of the camera-work, too, which renders something like this almost completely pointless. And while the 1980s Friday films aren't what I'd call genre classics, you could at least clearly make out the gory scenes instead of getting a split flash of some CGI effect while the cameraman goes into a seizure. Bah-humbug, I know. But I swear I really did try my best to like this one. Honest!<br /><br />Defenders of this latest bargain basement remake will say things like...<br /><br />\"It's not supposed to have a storyline or plot!\" or \"The acting is supposed to be bad!\" or \"The dialogue is supposed to be stupid!\" or \"The characters are supposed to be unbearably obnoxious and annoying!\" or \"It's not supposed to be scary!\" Well OK then. I'd now like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Nispel for making an unscary, ugly-looking, suspense-free movie with bad acting, terrible dialogue, forgettable kills and annoying characters. Way to go Marcus!<br /><br />What other \"goodies\" do we get here? Let's see...<br /><br />For some reason, the film opens with all the credits but waits until about twenty minutes in to reveal the TITLE. <br /><br />Half of the dialogue seems to consist of either the \"f\" word or \"dude.\" And what's up with every person talking to themselves? Every time a person was alone they were having a conversation. With whom? I have no clue. When a floorboard creaks it's not really necessary to have someone say \"What was that? I better go upstairs and see what that is!\" Or, in Friday remake terms it's more like... \"What tha @#!* was that @#!* ? Dayum I need to go up doz @#!*' stairs to investigate me some @#!*!\" The characters are all pretty awful - a bunch of annoying, smug, self-satisfied, foul-mouthed twits who seem like they need to immediately be committed to a rehab program. Naturally all the white characters get to pair off and have sex, while no one seems the least bit interested in the one black and one Asian character. Since the black guy can't get laid he's reduced to pleasuring himself while listening to whitey going at it upstairs. At least three different male victims said \"What the @#!*?\" when they were confronted with Jason. The black guy had a slight variation though since he's black. Seriously, whoever wrote this should be embarrassed.<br /><br />The cast was also bad. Travis Van Winkle should never act again. What is the appeal of this guy anyway? He can't act for squat and resembles Vincent from the Beauty and the Beast TV series. And Jared Padalecki (though one of the better actors here) would probably look better without the Farrah Fawcett hairdo. I had a very difficult time telling the actresses they hired apart. When blonde #1 was killed and they cut back to the cabin to blonde #2 I was like \"I thought she was already dead?\" And then there's a missing sister, who I kept confusing with the rich jock's girlfriend toward the end. If you can hire a black and an Asian actor to help diffuse all the shaggy-haired white boys, then why can't you hire an attractive black or Asian actress? Preferrably one who isn't sporting a set of distracting and unnatural-looking silicone cans like several actresses in this film. No wonder Willa Ford couldn't keep herself under water for long! Note to parents: If your 18-year-old daughter begs you for a set of DD bolt-on's for her 18th birthday, get her a Prada handbag instead. She'll thank you later. <br /><br />The film is full of extremely stupid moments and scenes. Getting hit directly in the head by a speedboat going about 50 miles per hour will only result in a tiny little boo-boo. And the extensive lair of underground catacombs under Jason's house? Did Jason dig all that out or is it some sewer system in the middle of the woods? Maybe a former coal mine... with an escape hatch through an overturned school bus? Whaaaaaaa? Then we have Jason keeping a hostage. Well, the Jason I like don't play like that. Are they trying to now \"humanize\" him like Rob Zombie did with Michael Myers in his equally wretched \"remake\" of HALLOWEEN? Urghhh...<br /><br />It all leads up to an ending that fails just as badly as the rest of the movie. The original has that legendary moment that made people jump from their seats while the people who made this botched that opportunity because of a completely awful editing cut. So I'm sad to say, but in my estimation, this was sloppy, irritating and pretty much just plain boring and tiresome. It could have been fun. It's not. At least to me.

{"id": 26692, "text": "***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, CONCERNING MAKE-UP EFFECTS, BUT NOT PLOT*** Well, Well. After years of video collecting, countless hours of fast-forwarding, and the occasional decent flick, I have finally got my hands on a copy of the infamous Antropophagus. I used to read old Threat Theatre catalogs, and issues of The Dark Side magazine, and I heard about all the Video Nasties, and Exploitation, and Trash, and think to myself, man it would be great to get my hands on some of that stuff. It all seems so rare and obscure like a cult collectors dream! But as i started to find ex-rental copies and bootlegs at flea-markets and such, I came to an even more shocking conclusion: Most of this trash, really is trash. Hardly are any of these films truly gorey or impressive, none of them live up to their American counterparts. I would gladly trade in my Francos, D'amatos, and Fulci's, any day for old-school Raimi, Savini, and Peter Jackson(New-Zealand). The definition of a Video Nasty, in truth, is simply any film that the British find offensive. It doesn't mean it's good, or that it will even shock you, it means that the British are far too easily offended!<br /><br />And so we have Antropophagus. From cult favorite, Joe D'amato. The version I own has the most ludicrous dubbing I have ever seen in my entire life, along with japanese subtitles. In the beginning of the film we are quickly treated to one of the better moments when a male victim laying on a beach receives a hatchet to the face. But sit tight, because that's all you get for the next hour, until finally the title character shows up. It's frustrating to say the least, when watching a horror movie, if the \"Bad Guy\" does not even appear ONCE during the first hour. I mean it, not even one shot of his face until the last 30 mins of the film. George Eastman plays the Antropophagus Beast, or the Grim Reaper, depending on which version you own. All in All, he is creepy, a good slasher'stalker type, but more laughable, than say Micheal Myers, or Jason Vorhees. All of the horror elements in this film are strictly routine, by the numbers type of fare. However the atmosphere created is unique. Although it is poorly executed, you can see the potential for something scary, within the great landscapes and sets on this island. Too bad the lame dialogue and ridiculous off time soundtrack ruin any possibility of suspense. I will admit one thing... unlike Jesus Franco and Lucio Fulci, I do like Joe D'amatos directing. This may sound like a long shot, but I like the way his films look, especially Emanuelle in America. He has good camera movement, and his films benefit greatly from a widescreen presentation.<br /><br />But back to the issue at hand. The gore scenes in this effort were far and few between (Yes, I have the UNCUT version!!!). Perhaps, judging by the cover and by the general buzz about this \"Nasty\" I was expecting some over the top gore-fest similar to Evil Dead or Bad Taste. Well I couldn't have been further from the truth. The amount of blood and guts in this film amounts to about 1 min of screen time. Theses moments consist of 1 hatchet to the face, 1 sword to the back, a couple of slit throats, 1 hanging and of course both the infamous \"Fetus for Lunch\" and \"Auto Cannibalism\" scenes. The first, is so quick and built up that its done before it even begins. Antropophagus reaches into the pregnant character and pulls out what looks like the fetus of a small animal, proceeds to take a single bite- and then Bam! -the scene ends!!!!!! What??? All that controversy over 20 seconds of that?? I could have made a more shocking scene on my Dads camcorder with a $20 budget. Talk about a rip-off. Anyone expecting some grotesque display of horror of the most graphic nature, will either throw their remote at the television set, or laugh themselves silly.<br /><br />On to the only other highlight or \"lowlight\"- depending on your point of view- of this movie. The scene in which Antropopo eats his own intestines. Again, i can't say enough how much of a disappointment this was. Antropopo takes an Axe to the chest (albeit, it's a hefty blow to the sternum), which looks incredibly fake. He then stuffs his mouth with some (half-decent) looking intestines that he pulls from said axe-wound which opened his chest. Then he collapses, and the movie is over. To be honest I found the goriest scene in the whole film to be when a girl victim is lifted through a hole in the roof by her neck. That seemed to be more shocking than either the fetus or intestines. I was expecting the most visceral thrills but this and the few other glimpses of gore were so quick and unimpressive, that as a gore-hound I was truly disappointed. There were no painfull close-ups or slow motion techniques used to glorify the bloodshed, which may make me sound sick and desperate, but I argue that this is what the typical fan of this kind of film will be looking for. If not, why would someone bother to go through all the trouble of locating an UNCUT copy, I ask??<br /><br />Bottom line- If your looking for a good fun romp with lots of carnage, try Don't Go In The Woods (1980), or Night of the Demon (1980, or more standard stuff like Dead Alive. If it's D'amato your looking for, I would suggest some of his more entertaining work like Troll 2, or the any of the Ator series. He also has quite the line of Porn and Erotic material, most of it easy to find, if that floats your boat. But if you MUST HAVE Antropophagus, I wouldn't recommend paying more than 10 bucks, as the best part of the movie is looking at the classic cover of the box it comes in. * 4/10", "sentiment": 0}

It might be subtitled The Life, Ambitions and Death of Nanny Ordway. Since it also is about theater people, Black Widow features some stylish dialogue, some clever performances and some back-biting relationships. And since the movie is based on a mystery written by Hugh Wheeler (under the pseudonym of Patrick Quentin), we have a story of uncomfortable psychological possibilities with at least two believable murder suspects and a story that, to my way of thinking, is satisfying and a bit sad. <br /><br />But is Black Widow a first-class movie? Not exactly, but it's a lot of fun if you like older movies. <br /><br />Nancy Ordway, \"Nanny\" (Peggy Ann Garner), is a 20 year-old want-to-be writer when she arrives in New York City knowing only an aging uncle who acts on Broadway when he can get jobs. Nanny has a way of moving up in the world. Before long she's met Peter Denver (Van Heflin), a successful producer, whose wife, Iris (Gene Tierney), is a beautiful and famous actress. Iris will be out of town for a few weeks. Nanny meets Brien Mullen (Reginald Gardiner), Peter and Iris' neighbor who, with his wife, the famous actress Carlotta Marin (Ginger Rogers), lives just above the Denvers in an equally swank penthouse apartment. Brien is a weak but charming man who knows his well-being depends on his imperious wife. \"I'm...well, to be perfectly honest with you, I'm Miss Carlotta Marin's husband,\" says Brien when he meets Nanny for the first time. \"I have a name of my own, of course, but it seems stupid to use it when I can get so much more attention simply telling whose husband I am.\" <br /><br />Nanny has also captivated the 21-year-old son of a rich Boston family. That's after she wangled an invitation to share digs with the young man's sister. Nanny by now has become friends with Peter, even to the point of his letting her use the apartment to write in while he's in the office and Iris is still out of town. Nanny, in other words, is a piece of work. <br /><br />When Nanny is found hanging in the Denver's bathroom on the evening Iris returns home, it's not long before Detective Bruce (George Raft) suspects it's not suicide, but murder...and Peter is the lead suspect. By the end of the movie we've learned Peter is dogged and desperate, but slowly figuring things out. Then we learn Detective Bruce is also figuring things out, and we may be in for a surprise. <br /><br />The sense of regret comes partly from some of the characters we've come to know. We may not admire them all, but we don't dislike them, either. Partly, though, it comes from the actors. All of them bring memories of better days. It's fun to see stars like Ginger Rogers, Van Heflin, Gene Tierney, George Raft and Reginald Gardiner do their stuff one more time in an A movie that's well written and directed,. We realize, however, that all of them are either on the slide downward or are just about to tip over. Even Peggy Ann Garner, a major child star a few years ago, wasn't able to parley this role into major adult status. <br /><br />For those who like to read mysteries and not just watch them, a trip to the used book stores in search of Patrick Quentin would be worth the time. Wheeler became part of Patrick Quentin in 1936 when, at 24, he began collaborating with Richard Webb. They also wrote under several other pseudonyms. Wheeler became the sole Patrick Quentin in the Fifties when Webb retired. Most of the Quentin mysteries feature Broadway producer Peter Duluth (changed to Denver for some reason in Black Widow). Start out with the Puzzle series that began in 1936 with A Puzzle for Fools, then on with A Puzzle for Players, ...for Puppets, ...for Warriors, ...for Fiends, ...for Pilgrims. Wheeler was a good writer who developed complex plots with solid characters and more style than you might expect. He turned to writing plays in the Sixties. In the Seventies he wrote the books for the Sondheim productions of A Little Night Music, Sweeney Todd and Pacific Overtures, as well as for Candide. His theater successes, unfortunately, tended to make people forget he was Patrick Quentin. He's worth reading again.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 31694, "text": "Seven children, seventeen nannies. Poor dad Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) has all but given up. Suddenly, enter Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) using her magical powers (both emotionally and literally) to kick them into shape. Remind you of something? I'd be concerned if it didn't. But thankfully, as Nanny McPhee progresses, it twists and turns in such a pleasant fashion that by the end, you'll be wondering 'Mary who?' Adapted for the screen by Thompson herself, this is a fun and inventive kids film that is guaranteed to make you smile. Firth does his usually stuttering British man shtick, but given he has little to do, makes the most of it. Imedla Staunton, Angela Lansbury and Celia Imrie ham it up shamelessly and are loads of fun. But most of the attention should be directed towards Thompson, an ugly but constantly entertaining lead.<br /><br />The art direction, visual effects and Patrick Doyle's fabulous score all soar in a confident over-the-top direction, as is the tone of the film. The score, by-the-books though it may be, is perfect and bodes well for Doyle's work on the new Harry Potter movie.<br /><br />Rather than basing its entirety on the naughty kids storyline, McPhee jumps from plot point to plot point, stuffing a whole lotta characters and twists into it's 97 minute running time. Thanks to this, Thompson's endearing loveliness and a cute array of kids (lead by Thomas Sangster, the kid from Love Actually), Nanny McPhee emerges triumphant as one of the better kids movies in recent memory, mostly because the adults will love it too. And anyone who isn't enchanted by the magical ending has to have a stone for a heart.", "sentiment": 0}

All the absolutely unlikable characters will remind viewers of someone they know. The neurotic parents, bratty kids, oblivious ditsy best friend, womanizer, smug arrogant boss and gay man conflicted about his homosexuality are all represented. As a fan of Molly Shannon and quirky off-beat movies, I was enthusiastic about seeing this film. As my husband and I watched this movie we kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. The movie just rambled pointlessly as the main character seemed to undergo a mental breakdown. By the end of the movie, most viewers will be convinced that Molly Shannon's character is a real fruitcake. Molly Shannon effectively conveys the image of a lonely spinster lacking in people skills who insulates herself from the hurts of the human experience by replacing them with animals. Despite her fine acting ability, she does not salvage this disaster of a movie. The final scene unconvincingly tries to convince us that the main character returns from the brink of a murderous mental breakdown and has an epiphany of self-discovering. It was pathetic. <br /><br />(Also a minor factor in my dislike of this movie is the representation of animal lovers and activists as unstable and potentially dangerous.)<br /><br />Synopsis- a complete waste 2 hours.

(All of this while doctors attempt to break through the survivors' catatonia).

Director Jim O'Connolly creates good atmosphere and tension, and pulls off a great reveal of the crazed island resident. The island is a very impressive study in blatant doom and gloom; it looks ominous right from the get go. The movie has great settings and just the right look.

The movies' little twists may not come off as all that surprising, but they're enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />The solid British cast does well at selling the material.

{"id": 48758, "text": "Paul Anderson makes movies that start off incredibly well. Every time I see a Paul W. S. Anderson movie, I watch the first twenty minutes and think \"Hey, this might actually be good!\" He raises expectations, gets you excited, pulls out all of his best tricks... and then somewhere around 30 minutes in, it turns to garbage. If you think about it, all of his movies from Event Horizon to Resident Evil suffer from this malady. AVP is no exception.<br /><br />In the opening scene, I watched an incredibly stylized alien-like silhouette turn into a satellite. And then it cut to a high tech lab, and then out to the desert, and then out to some glacier. As Paul Anderson assembled his team of protagonists, the movie had a distinct \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" or \"Jurassic Park\" vibe. In fact, now that I think about it, it had all the trappings of a Spielberg movie. The cherry on top of the sundae was when the wealthy tycoon Weyland, who was organizing the search party, turned out to be the actor who played \"Bishop\" in Aliens. I was on for the ride. I gripped my popcorn, I buckled in. I thought Paul Anderson had finally come into his own as a filmmaker... and he couldn't have picked a better time. Here was the unification of two of my favorite Science Fiction/Horror characters. If ever Paul Anderson was going to step up and be a real director, the time was now. I smiled, I squeezed my date's hand. This was gonna be great...<br /><br />And then, it started to suck. Gradually at first, almost as if Anderson was thinking that if he just gave us a great opening we might forget about the fact that the rest of the movie was terrible. I figured things were going badly when the heroes enter a pyramid that they've found thousands (millions?) of feet beneath an arctic whaling station. Hokey, yes... but I'm still buying it. And then, our heroes venture inside this ancient edifice and are trapped inside the pyramid because they decided to take some Predator guns. You'd think these people never saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. I kept waiting for someone to bust out a bull whip. The only thing that was missing was the flying darts and the big boulder.<br /><br />At this point in the movie, I got a really vivid mental picture of Paul Anderson standing in his living room, with DVD copies of Alien, Predator, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Cube laid out on the floor, and he's standing there taking a leak on all of them and laughing maniacally. I'm not kidding. That image flashed through my head.<br /><br />Anyway, so when I finally shook myself out of it, there were people that were getting attacked by face-huggers that were bullet-timed a la the Matrix (and every other action movie since). I mentally added The Matrix to the DVDs on Paul's floor, covered with urine. These same people give birth to aliens a mere five minutes later. Suddenly the gestation period for aliens shortened by like three days. I think that might have made me angrier than anything. I just wanted to drive to Paul Anderson's house in the middle of the night, grab him and say, \"There are rules to think about here, Paul. Not a lot of them, but you do need to respect the movies that came before. I understand that it makes your job a little tougher because you want to tell a story about an alien, and you need to have it bust out of somebody's chest pretty early in the story... but you're getting paid a lot of money to figure out a clever way of making it work.\"<br /><br />But even so, I kept watching. I had come this far, I needed to see the title bout. I watched clunky Predators with ridiculous dreadlocks fight with equally clumsy Aliens. All I could think was, \"Gee, I bet it's hot inside those suits.\" You could practically smell the latex. Still, there are some fun moments, so I keep watching.<br /><br />And then the protagonist becomes best friends with a Predator and they go off to hunt Aliens together like Butch and Sundance. All of this comes at great expense as you are forced to watch our heroine playing a goofy game of charades with the Predator. When Predators start acting, you know you're in trouble.The end fight scene with the Alien Queen Mum is pretty good. I actually started to enjoy myself again in the last ten minutes of the movie. And then I remembered that I felt the same way about Resident Evil. That last shot with Milla in the city was great. It made me rethink my P.W.S. Anderson theory. Maybe he makes movies that begin and end really well, and then fills them with processed meat. If I ever choose to see another one of his movies, I'm going to walk out after twenty minutes, go get something to eat, and then come back for the last ten and see how I feel about it.", "sentiment": 0}

Well then I have news for you: don't go see \"Shoot Em' Up\".<br /><br />But it's a shame that you won't. The film whose trailer I pointed to and said 'that's what film-making has come to these days; all attitude and no heart', turns out to be the most fun and riotous satire I've seen in a long time. \"Shoot Em' Up\"--a relentless, simultaneously energizing and hilarious movie--is a surprisingly smart confection. As conceived by writer-director Mike Davis its an over-the-top send-up of every action film ever made; a wink and a nod (as well as a parody of) to the bloody overkill of \"Die Hard\" and \"Rambo\", the gleeful excitement and charm of \"Indiana Jones\", the cornball abandon of \"James Bond\", the who cares of \"North by Northwest\", the heroic terseness and ease of \"Bourne\", the ultra-stylized and preposterous overdrive of \"The Matrix\" or anything ever made by John Woo (particularly a love for \"Hard-Boiled\"), and even in one scene the splendid lunacy of \"Raising Arizona\".<br /><br />The whole project, through controlled chaos and witty abandon, is made as a single, continuous in-joke. As in most films that take themselves too seriously, Clive Owen's hero (enigmatically titled Mr. Smith) quite literally never stops shooting. He shoots while having sex, he shoots while in the middle of free-fall, he shoots the umbilical cord off of a baby, he shoots with his fingers broken. Davis takes over-the-top to a whole new level; poking fun at action movies by taking their ridiculousness to its brinking point.<br /><br />Everything is done with an intentional preposterousness. For no reason Smith takes the baby of a dead woman (whom he helped deliver...in a frenetic shootout nonetheless) and decides to protect the infant from Paul Giamatti (dropping his nice-guy smugness, and superbly playing his diabolical villain with maniacal glee) and his army of goonish gunmen (why are they even after it?). For no reason, Smith just happens to be the world's greatest gunslinger (he doesn't miss; he doesn't break a sweat...in fact the whole movie Owen plays Smith as the ultimate joke: with a straight face. Same expression for killing, sex, talking, anything).<br /><br />The enigmatic coincidence of it all is only part of the film's joy (and when it begins to explain some its elements, that's where it goes wrong). Mostly its about the cartoonish, endlessly inventive shootouts; each staged with more ludicrous precision than the last. Its both funny and exceptionally filmed; the dialogue another homage to the stupidity of action films (among Smith's witty remarks: \"Eat your vegetables\" he laments after impaling a man with a carrot).<br /><br />And what is an action film without (besides a huge body count; a beautiful woman who does no more than look hot and talk sexy--kudos to Monica Bellucci) quirks for its hero? Smith is all caricature with a few cartoony peeves. For one he hates a lot of things (including bad drivers), but more importantly he has a fondness for carrots (\"they make your eyesight better\" he growls); he even turns them into weapons.<br /><br />\"Shoot Em' Up\" does all that it can to be every kind of action-movie. And it succeeds; staging endless fight after fight in every way imaginable, never repeating itself and quite literally ending with a bang. 9/10 <br /><br />\"I hate ponytails.

{"id": 8316, "text": "There was a film I reviewed a bit ago entitled \"13 Seconds\", in which your typical horror genre gets a confusing twist ending coupled with horrid acting and a bland plot. As you can tell, I wasn't a fan of this film and was momentarily turned away from cheap horror movies. \"13 Seconds\" garnered several awards, is recognized in the film community, but for me was just a sloppy film with the irritable inconsistent voice dub. I think that is what harmed this film the most  but then I gave up on my plight to avoid cheap horror films and decided to watch the equally low-budget horror/suspense/thriller film \"The Attic Expeditions\", and I must admit, I was rejuvenated. This film was a breath of confusing fresh air. From the sporadic, yet strong, opening, through the rest of this nonconsecutive film about magik (with a \"K\"), the philosophy of modern medicine, and perhaps love, I was hooked. From the films that I have watched lately, this was one that I was eager to start from the beginning and watch again. While I cannot say that director Jeremy Kasten has created a flawless film, he has impressed me by giving us a strong story with a limited budget. This was a film obviously loved by everyone involved and in my eyes has the ability to become a cult classic if watched by an open-mind audience.<br /><br />We follow the story of Trevor Blackburn, who may or may not have killed his fiancé while performing a magik ritual. Due to possible insanity, he is operated on and forced to recuperate in a facility simply called \"House of Love\". It is in this \"house\" that Trevor continues to have flashbacks coupled with nightmares, coupled with sudden murders of the other tenants. He is observed, from a distance  through television monitors, by a Dr. Eck (played sinisterly by Jeffrey Combs) and his associate, Dr. Coffee (played by Ted Raimi). This give us the impression that perhaps this is not the place we assume, and that it is just a set-up by Eck for a more dutiful purpose. Then, quite classically, as we think we know the truth to this film, director Kasten gives us one last push of the unknown and before the screen our minds are shattered.<br /><br />I think what appealed to me the most was that albeit this was a very low-budget film, the creators did everything possible to make this less cheap and more detail oriented. I loved the visual style of this film. The way that our characters acted, the way the interacted with each other, and their deadpan ability to bring the unknown to the surface. It was as if I was watching \"Evil Dead\" for the first time (not that I want to draw similarities  it was just a similar viewing experience). There were elements of Gilliam, mixed with Raimi, mixed with Nolan all rolled together. Although the international name for this film is \"Memento 2\", please do not connect the two. This film stands on its own. Kasten assembled a flawless cast with a surprising turn from Seth Green (playing a very Patrick Bateman character) and the always fun Jeffrey Combs. I even enjoyed the Kyle MacLachlan-esquire style of Andras Jones  then there was Ted Raimi, whom didn't almost fit within this film, but still made it fun to see him sweat. Alas, those eager to see Alice Cooper, he was only in it for a brief moment, though the special features claim he was a valuable asset to the production. I didn't see it. With this seemingly strong cast in place, it was up to the storyteller to get the rest in motion  and it happens successfully.<br /><br />\"The Attic Expeditions\" is not a one-time-viewing film. I think what makes me rave so much about this film is the way the story was told, out of context, out of consecutive order, out of sanity. You cannot make an assumption about this film from just one viewing, one must go back  rewatch, and enjoy. I will say this much, it is not a film for everyone. The scenes can be unsettling and a bit disturbing since you do not quite fully know if he is in his mind or in ours. Rather disturbing actually. Kasten plays not only with the character's minds, but also with ours. \"The Attic Expeditions\" is one of those films that leaves the room either going, \"gosh that was horrible\", or wide open for discussion. For me, I needed someone to talk to. I wasn't sure what was real, and what was in Trevor's mind. That is what makes this film stand out. While there were some shots of a boom in some scenes, but again, that is what makes this low-budget film even better. Concentrate on what you cannot comprehend, and this will be a phenomenal film for you.<br /><br />Overall, I gotta say that after a slew of mediocre Hollywood budget films, this was a volatile breath of fresh air. I challenge anyone that dislikes this film to ask \"why\" -- is it because you didn't understand the story or because it was cheaper than the mass produced films. With a film like \"The Attic Expeditions\", more chances are taken  the risks are higher, and the final product is worth a second viewing. As others have quoted, and I believe them, this is a horror film for those of us that pride ourselves on intelligence. It is smart, challenging, and grossly entertaining. I don't mind calling this film cheap because it entertained me mentally, and I will go back to rewatch to see if a second viewing would un-muddle the questions looming in my mind. I was impressed.<br /><br />If I went insane, I would definitely choose Dr. Eck to ensure my return of sanity! <br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****", "sentiment": 0}

It is a little like Yojimbo meets Pale rider.<br /><br />First I want to clear up a significant error that most reviewers are making comparing this movie to Spagetti westerns. This movie is NOT a copy of a Spagetti westers. In fact most Spagetti westerns ARE copies of old Samurai films many written by Akira Kurosawa. This movie has similarities with Fistfull of dollars which came out in 1964. But Fistfull is a almost word for word copy of Yojimbo which came out in 1961, just substitute a gun for a sword. Anyway BOTH Sergio Leone and Akira Kurosawa made wonderful movies.<br /><br />OK let me start by saying the story only starts slow...and kind of cheesy with the whole Tarantino sitting around a campfire with fake Mt Fuji in the back. But all the old westerns and samurai films should have trained you to be patient in the first 15min.<br /><br />The filming is brilliant has just enough color in the background, just the right amount of lighting, nice mix of angry close-ups on hero and bad guys faces. Where the movie excels in a way Kurosawa would be proud is the well used special effects mini explosion bullets, exploding blood packs and my new favorite big bullet holes. <br /><br />There is a lot of clever little homage bits like Eastwood's poncho and Van Cleef's long shot gun.<br /><br />The only points off are for the dumb part by the sheriff.

But it also has a ropey plot, poor acting from the three leading women (including the beautiful Jean Wallace) and its one leading man, Cornel Wilde, and a suave but unmenacing villain, the blandly-named Mr. Brown. There are also some moments where low production values produce moments that might be from a comic strip: the private airport set identified by nothing (such as an aeroplane or runway) that reveals its function but simply by a sign reading \"Private Airport\", for example; or the box of labelled dynamite. The ending is also weak, not because the idea (a shoot-out in the fog) is bad, but because it's impossible to believe, while watching it, that you're seeing anything other than one man alone in a studio pretending to be in a fight.

When they made vampire ash a drug that gave users a short burst of vampiric powers, the dealer was caught and beaten within the first 5 minutes. How dramatic.

From the moment I started watching it to the blessed moment when the credits finally rolled, I was stunned at the sheer awfulness of this movie. It very obviously tries *so hard* to be deep and meaningful, and falls flat at every turn. The jarring and distracting camera work, \"moody\" insufficient lighting, and cliché-ridden plot made the film nearly unwatchable. I kept watching only because I thought maybe it would pull together by the end. It never does.<br /><br />What this movie is, is a pile of disjointed plot fragments, inane dialogue, and Dysfunctional Archetype characters, lurching around for an hour and forty-five minutes. Gale, who I think is a very talented actor, was completely unbelievable as a germophobe. I blame this on writing and directing. In some situations he is shown as extreme--using an alcohol wipe to open his own medicine cabinet door, for example--but then the next second he is touching people and objects willy-nilly and not appearing to be bothered at all. It's very inconsistent and completely fails at credibility.<br /><br />The \"style\" of the movie is to cut away from shots and scenes before the audience can figure out what they are supposed to mean, because that's \"deep\" and \"mysterious\" or something. By the end you are supposed to assemble the rubble you've been shown into some sort of cohesive unit, but not only does it not all fit together, but I was left not really caring one way or the other. It was so disjointed that I never came to care about anyone or anything being shown.

For me, it was the chronicle of that small group of people who don't, and probably never will, quite fit into this world. They're here on the fringes though, just existing in their own parallel universe, or their own \"ghost world.\" Though it sounds depressing, this film is hardly a downer, it's full of humor, satire and acute observations on life. The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning)... plus it pulls off the impossible by successfully steering toward dead-on seriousness near the conclusion to drive it's point across.<br /><br />It begins at graduation with Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), two very perceptive high school outcasts who see right through the facade of their juvenile peers and want nothing to do with it. For Rebecca this self-ostracizing is just a passing phasing, but for Enid you get the strong impression this is going to always be her way of life. It's not that she doesn't get it, it's that she's doesn't understand IT or people or the games of life. There's a brief emotional turning point for Enid when a cruel practical joke backfires and she becomes involved with the target, the nerdy and very sardonic Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who may just be the kindred spirit Enid was looking for. The shared scenes between Enid and Seymour, though doomed to take a bad turn, are handled with tenderness by the director and actors and are quite memorable and touching.<br /><br />Highlights are an excellent scene in a blues club that just about nails the American outlook on life and our lack of reverence and the ones in Enid's remedial art class, with the most misguided and pretentious teacher (Illeana Douglas) you could imagine. The girls are wonderful, and Steve Buscemi was unfairly overlooked at awards time (big shocker). Anyway, he's never been this good before.

{"id": 5658, "text": "Remembered as one of the earliest television directors, Barry Shear made occasional visits to the motion picture industry and created a handful of serviceable films dating from 1968. Of this small group, the urban crime drama 'Across 110th Street' will probably remain his best-known, although it seems destined for eternal life in obscurity.<br /><br />'Across 110th Street' was released on the advent of blaxploitation films and other urban Black dramas, making it cutting edge for its time. However, this nasty, unremitting tale of ghetto life has little of the veneer and stylization that have made other 1970s titles like 'Shaft' and 'Truck Turner' endure in the American conscience. 'Across 110th Street,' for all of its violence and anger, is understated and keeps glamor completely out of the loop. <br /><br />Borrowing from a novel by Wally Ferris, 'Across 110th Street' is centered on three Harlem men who are desperate to escape their poor backgrounds: ex-convict and apartment super Jim Harris (Paul Benjamin), dry cleaner Joe Logart (Ed Bernard), and playboy Henry Jackson (Antonio Fargas). The three friends barge into a mafia cash count with Harris and Logart disguised as police officers and Jackson driving their getaway car. They speed off with $300,000, leaving behind seven dead men, including two cops. <br /><br />Harris, Logart, and Jackson spend their time hiding from an investigation by older, White detective Mattelli (Anthony Quinn) and young, Black lieutenant Pope (Yaphet Kotto) while avoiding Black mobster Doc Johnson (Richard Ward) and Italian mafioso Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa), who are looking to recover their stake. The hunt for these three men becomes a race between two factions, the police and organized crime, with racial tensions being set off along the way. <br /><br />Unlike better-known blaxploitation films that combine social problems with heroic acts, 'Across 110th Street' uses a completely naturalistic setting, where everyone from citizens to cops are looking merely to stay alive; mob men drive fear into innocent people, cops take kickbacks from drug and gambling rings, and those raised in poverty go to unthinkable extremes for a few extra dollars. The entire atmosphere of '110th' is grim, unsettling, and unremitting, with no one immune from the sickness of modern life. <br /><br />Barry Shear's direction is strong, bringing out excellent performances by Quinn, Kotto, Benjamin, and the supporting cast. While Shear's style of direction is not very imaginative, he makes use of tight surroundings to create the hot, claustrophobic aura that 'Across 110th Street' needs. Most of the film is shot in confined locations, such as tenements, small businesses, and police precincts, which Shear uses to magnify the friction between each character.<br /><br />The film (co-produced by Shear, Quinn, and three others) seems to have been made on a limited budget, as indicated by its below-average technical work. The photography by Jack Priestley is quite good, but there are off-moments involving out-of-sync dialogue and poor Foley effects. This in no way spoils the film's impact, but the overall quality is somewhat pulled down. The score by J.J. Johnson (with solos by Bobby Womack) does hold up nicely, always with a feel of menace.<br /><br />Even with Black dramas from the 1970s being rediscovered, 'Across 110th Street' seems to lag considerably behind other titles. Quentin Tarentino's borrowing of the title song for use in 'Jackie Brown' has helped to give the film some new exposure, perhaps enough to bring a modern-day reevaluation. But for now, '110th' holds its place as a forgotten landmark of Black film-making, still entertaining a limited audience.<br /><br />'Across 110th Street' has been given a (surprise!) mediocre release by MGM Home Video as part of its Soul Cinema collection. The film is presented in widescreen with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track; Spanish and French 'dubbing' are offered besides three-language subtitles. The film's print is in good condition with some visible artifacts and occasional grain. The audio is poorly balanced, however, with dialogue often muffled by adjacent noise. It seems that the film has been repaired to an extent, but MGM didn't go far enough to make 'Across 110th Street' the pristine film it could be. And once again, Dolby enhancement serves as a handicap, not an improvement, to pre-stereo films. The theatrical trailer, also in fair shape, is offered as an extra.<br /><br />*** out of 4<br /><br />Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr", "sentiment": 0}

But so much is changed, and so many critical elements removed, that it hardly resembles its novel origins. As a result I find it difficult to believe that Tom Clancy had much creative control over this effort, though he's credited as \"Executive Producer\".<br /><br />First, for some inexplicable reason, this movie jumps away from previous Clancy continuity by completely revamping the character of Jack Ryan. Rather than a middle aged CIA administrator, Ryan is now a young handsome PhD with little Washington experience. Apparently this is to boost the \"chick-flick\" quotient of this outing, as it adds nothing tangible to the film, and only detracts from the continuity that had been built to this point. There's even a scene where Kathy is asked how \"cute\" Ryan is on a 1-10 scale, and she says a \"12\". Ugh! They had time to include this garbage, yet skip vital character development later in the film?<br /><br />Yet, even worse, this Ryan is the Uber-Ryan. Yes, the man is everywhere, and involved in virtually every action sequence in the film. He finds the bomb lab in Russia (and saves Clark, CLARK, for crying out loud, shouldn't it be the OTHER way around???), races to Baltimore in a helicopter to warn President Fowler(who in yet another huge change is caught in the blast himself) he gets caught in the nuclear blast(and hardly gets his hair mussed, how cliche!), he personally sifts through the rubble of Baltimore for evidence (another inexplicable change, as Denver was the city nuked in the book, then goes on for a cliched confrontation with the terrorists (who are VERY poorly developed character-wise, totally unlike the book) mano y mano in a darkened Baltimore warehouse. Oh, and I almost forgot, there was the obligatory (and oh so overused) Hollywood \"death\" scene where Ryan (again, Ryan personally) kneels at the bed of Morgan Freeman as he expires in a \"tearful\" sequence. Yes, it was painful but not in the way intended.<br /><br />I thought Clancy's books sometimes stretched the believablity of Ryan's capabilities to the breaking point, yet this goes way beyond anything Clancy has previously done. It's Super-Ryan to the rescue, more 007 than distinguished, cerebral CIA analyst, even though he supposedly had little if any experience in espionage, forensics, or any of that. It is very cliched, and very tiresome to watch, at least for anyone that's actually read the books.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the novel was the realism. Reading it, you really believed that the plot Clancy put in motion could occur. Not this movie. Believable Islamic terrorists were replaced with cartoonish middle-aged white european neo-Nazis who make stock Hitler-loving speeches that any avid movie-goer has heard a million times before. Dr. Evil would love these guys. They even got to kill one of their own rank, ala Dr. Evil, after he experienced the convenient cinematic \"crisis of concience\". You could see it coming a mile away! I guess that's so we can understand these men are serious and mean \"business\"<br /><br />Oh and on the subject of business, since the typical european Neo-Nazi is young, skinheaded, devoted, but not terribly affluent these Nazis were conveniently well-to-do businessmen with the financial assets and experience to put their scheme in motion. Is this Tom Clancy or James Bond? I guess its not \"politically correct\" to feature the actual type of real world Middle Eastern \"gentlemen\", with the aid of foreign government sponsorship who even now are striving, again in reality, to make weapons of mass destruction to use against us? I guess its always \"safe\" to once again bash caucasian conservative-appearing men in business suits. Whatever the reason, its another major plot element from the book down the tubes.<br /><br />On the subject of the bomb; there was a great deal of detail in the book about the bomb that was completely overlooked in the movie. For example, in the book, the bomb was originally intended to be a multi-stage, ie, HYDROGEN bomb. It fizzled. The original yield was overestimated by twenty fold by military analysts because of reflection of the snow, and other factors. The President's advisors didn't think terrorists could build a multi-stage weapon, thus the suspicion was immediately upon the Russians. It was only after frantic detective work that the true yield of the bomb was discovered, and it put Ryan on the proper track AND gave him leverage to help defuse the situation(no pun intended). It's a common worry that terrorist groups might get ahold of a low yield fission \"suitcase\" bombs, yet right from the start in the movie no one, including the President, suspects terrorists!<br /><br />Another fond memory I have of the book is that Clancy took us to the very brink of Armageddon where the US and Russia were nearly in a shooting war because of the misinterpreted size of the bomb, and the tank battle that the German terrorists cause to happen in Berlin. Yet here, the Russians attack and virtually destroy a US nuclear carrier, we bomb a Russian airbase, and we're still standing at that brink. Somehow, I think if events got that far, there'd be no turning back. Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote the book; he seems to have forgotten it here though.<br /><br />These are just a few of the major problems with this film. The pacing is bad; one minute the bomb is still being constructed, and a few minutes later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode, with the cliche of Ryan hot on the trail, trying to warn the President. In the book, the bomb catches everyone completely off-guard, but not here, ANOTHER irritating change. There is also very little character development, the President's motivations are poorly understood, the paranoia of Fowler over the new Russian President's motives was poorly developed, etc etc.<br /><br />Avoid it if you can. I turned the last 5 minutes off, it was so bad.<br /><br />", "sentiment": 0}

Director Richard Rush occasionally does fluid work here, and the film has fervently funny and thoughtful scenes, however Robert Kaufman's hot-headed script, adapted from Ken Kolb's novel, is awash with half-realized ideas. The kids sound off violently against the University's directors, but we're never made aware of what they want--or what they want done about their concerns. Made during an era wherein young people hoped to change the world--and get laid--the characters in this picture nevertheless are just sounding-boards for the writer. Topics are brought up not to be discussed but to be challenged (and, in these cases, the kids are just as blind as their professional elders). Was that Kaufman's point, that student riots really ARE just violent preludes to sex and otherwise a waste of time? Gould's shaggy character rants and raves too, but his Harry Bailey presents a different problem: he cheats, he lies, he cuts corners, he heartily embraces his own set of values and yet is happily corrupt! A hypocrite himself, Bailey loves teaching, loves kids and their innocence, but he doesn't see his own short-comings--and I'm not sure the filmmakers do, either. Bailey is a one-sided writer's creation (and oddly, for a movie filled with so many liberal stances, Bailey--like most of the other characters--is anti-female and homophobic). Candice Bergen (in a wan performance) plays Gould's shiksa goddess girlfriend who doesn't like being called a WASP and who would give up everything to be married in the suburbs. She's continually put down for that, as if she's a sell-out, and yet how exactly would Gould live if he were to achieve his dream of being a high school teacher? As it is, he can't even pay the rent on his apartment! The riot sequences are staged for utter seriousness--and they are filmed and edited with precision--but they don't come organically out of this story, they are interjected for shock value. The rage and anger presented here is convincing, but the cause is confusing. These students don't seem to want peace at all, and neither does director Rush. The narrative is pushed towards violence for no other purpose except to vividly stage two movie riots. This is exploitation, and the crummy feeling one gets from the picture can be related right back to the people behind it: they're hypocrites, too. *1/2 from ****", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 15922, "text": "Robert Crumb became an idol among hippies in the 1960's because of the psychedelic comics he drew at the time. In this excellent film, directed by Terry Zwigoff (who also directed the excellent, and also comic book related, \"Ghost World\" and \"American Splendor\") Crumb starts out by telling that he hates just about all the work he is most famous for. This is typical, Í think, of Crumb: he is uncompromisingly politically incorrect, completely unafraid to speak his mind openly, and above all disgusted by the idea of selling out for money.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Crumb ever since I advanced beyond Donald Duck and Marvel Comics about 20 years ago (this is not to say that I don't love Donald or Marvel anymore, because I do). Crumb is probably the most talented comic book artist of the latter half of the 20t Century. Quite simply, I don't think anyone can draw as well as he does. He is not much of a storyteller, but like I pointed out above, that is more than made up by the fact that he is always totally candid about his life, sometimes painfully and embarrassingly so.<br /><br />\"Crumb\" is an excellent portrait of an exceptionally talented artist who also happens to be a total pervert.

Seeing one of these \"B\" Westerns some sixty years after they were made is a neat exercise in nostalgia, and only goes to show how far films have come since the good old days.<br /><br />As far as shoot 'em ups go, this one has a lot of them, about every ten minutes between different factions. Like many (most?) of these oaters, the title doesn't really have much to do with the story, though this one comes close. But instead of \"Border Feud\", why couldn't it have been the \"Blue Girl Gold Mine Feud\"? That would have made more sense and better described the action.<br /><br />Lash LaRue's character is Marshal Cheyenne Davis, helping out Sheriff Fuzzy Q. Jones (Fuzzy St. John) sort out the differences between two feuding families over gold mine rights in the town of Red Gulch. However there's a third party interested in keeping hostilities going; Jack Barton (Bob Duncan) and his backer Doc Peters (Ian Keith) plan to move in when the families wipe each other out. It might have worked too, but with a cute Condon sister (Gloria Marlen) romanced by the opposing family's Bob Hart (Kenneth Farrell), the truth will have to make things right.<br /><br />You can tell this PRC picture (Producers Releasing Corporation) film is an entirely low budget affair. Watch for a scene in the second half when Fuzzy shoots one of Barton's bad guys, he repositions himself ever so slightly so he can continue to fall down a stairway - no time for do-overs.<br /><br />\"Border Feud\", along with most of these era Westerns are great for a one hour diversion, as long as they're not taken too seriously.

{"id": 12471, "text": "You might wonder, what kind of movie is Two-Lane Blacktop for? The cover might suggest a road movie, or the premise that it's about drag racers going across the country, one in a grey Chevy and the other in a GTO, would make it an action or chase movie. Or having the random pairing of music stars Dennis Wilson (Beach Boys) and James Taylor (the latter in his only film), accompanied by Warren Oates, would make it an oddity of movie casting. It is a road movie, but in the same sense that Camus' The Stranger is a movie about murder. One has to hearken back to Ebert's saying of a movie's interest not being in what it's about but how it's about it. This is a film where we keep getting sidetracked from the conventions and get into a framework that's contemplative, quiet a lot of times.<br /><br />Indeed the big word for Two-Lane Blacktop is alienation. The way it was made itself was alienating (in a possible tip-of-the-hat to Godard with Breathless, the cast didn't get the script, despite being written by a brilliant novelist named Rudy Wurlitzer), its characters alienating to each other even as they never get too aggressive or over-active. In fact, it's a truly fascinating study of inertness; these characters only have to suggest, or barely even that, how they're outcasts. Little physical gestures like the way that Taylor's Driver stops to hear love-making in a motel room, stands by the door a moment partially frozen, and then sits with knees folded to the chest for what would appear to be quite a while. Or just those interactions the Driver, Mechanic, GTO and Girl have when they stop to get a bite to eat or get gas or a new part.<br /><br />It's a chase movie, therefore, without the chase. This will frustrate most viewers not ready for it, that much should be clear. There is no real 'story', and whenever things look like they're about to pick up in terms of \"things happening\", like the scene where the GTO is pulled over by the cop and Driver to stops to give an unnecessary lie or when Girl makes the decision to ride with GTO, other things take its place to suddenly move it into just being about something else entirely. Maybe that is, in a sense, why it's a pure road movie. We're on it with them, it's sincerely realistic (if maybe leaning toward the super-stoic), and it's gorgeous to look at almost all of the time. Not just the obvious of the cars on route 66, but little things like the compositions at night of the riders in the car, the steadiness that adds to the minimalism.<br /><br />From its performances by professional (Oates and Stanton's walk-on) and non (everybody else), to the sturdy visual obsession with the physical prowess of 60s/70s cars, it's ultimately a great movie to just watch by yourself, in your home late at night, and sit and really think about what you saw.

{"id": 22308, "text": "It is hard to believe it is just over twenty years since 'Red Dwarf' blasted onto our screens. I watched the first episode for two reasons; firstly, it was the work of Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, writers I knew from their work on 'Carrott's Lib' and 'Spitting Image', and secondly, it combined two life-long interests of mine - comedy and science fiction.<br /><br />The premise is this - mining ship 'Red Dwarf' has suffered a disaster in space, meaning that most of its crew are dead. The only survivor is Dave Lister ( Craig Charles ), a slob who loves getting drunk and eating curry. Also around are a life form descended from a cat he smuggled on board, called 'Cat' ( Danny John-Jules ), who acts like James Brown, and Arnold Rimmer ( Chris Barrie ), a hologram of an unpopular technician. There's also a talking computer called 'Holly', played first by Norman Lovett and then Hattie Hayridge.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the opening episode, so like the Smeghead that I am did not bother with the show again until it reached its third season. 'Backwards' opened with a hilarious conversation between Lister and Cat in which the former expressed a secret desire for Wilma Flintstone. It convinced me that the show had changed for the better ( I later caught up with the ones I had missed, and found they were not bad either ). The same episode brought in as a regular 'Kryten' ( David Ross, then Robert Llewelyn ), a robot who speaks in a Canadian accent and who by his own admission looks like Herman Munster's stunt double.<br /><br />The show could have been called 'Lads In Space'. The cast were superb, particularly Barrie as the conceited 'Rimmer', the scripts cleverly exploited the fine line between comedy and sci-fi, and for my money it was one of the best sitcoms of the '90's, alongside 'I'm Alan Partridge' and 'Father Ted'. Among the many first-rate episodes were 'Demons & Angels' ( the boys meet evil versions of themselves ), 'Gunmen Of The Apocalypse' ( the boys in a space western ), 'Timeslides' ( Rimmer tries to change the course of his own history ), 'D.N.A.' ( Kryten learns what it is like to be human ), 'Dimension Jump' ( Rimmer meets a heroic version of himself - 'Ace' Rimmer ). Best of all was 'Back To Reality' in which the boys think that their 'Dwarf' experiences have all been part of a Virtual Reality game. Cat's cries of 'Dwayne Dibbley!' were hilarious! With such a strong cast and production crew, the show attained a peak of perfection unseen in British comedy for years previously - and some would say, not since. It was also a hit in America, and they attempted their own version, from all accounts it was not very good.<br /><br />Sadly, Naylor and Grant parted company, and the seventh season was written by Naylor and other writers such as Kim Fuller. Robert Llewelyn himself co-wrote one. The absence of Grant, plus a move onto film, and Chris Barrie only appearing in a handful of episodes, resulted in Season Seven looking a bit patchy. The inclusion of a new female character - 'Kochanski' ( Chloe Annett ) made things worse. She was to the boys from the Dwarf what Zeppo had been to the Marx Bros.<br /><br />Things perked up a bit in Season Eight. Rimmer came back full-time, Norman Lovett returned as 'Holly', and Naylor wrote every episode alone, ensuring the comedy was more consistent. Bringing back the entire crew, including the Captain, was a mistake though ( as was the retaining of Kochanski ). The show simply did not need them.<br /><br />And that sadly is where the 'Red Dwarf' story ends. It is now ten years since the transmission of Season Eight. Naylor has tried to get a 'Dwarf' feature film made but without success. I wish he had instead devoted the time to writing more television episodes. <br /><br />'Sky Television' have announced a pair of specials for transmission sometime in the year. Hopefully they will feature the original cast. The idea of a bunch of nobodies as 'Rimmer', 'Cat', 'Lister' et al does not exactly thrill me.", "sentiment": 0}

In fact there are only two such films I have seen this year that I felt had no redeeming qualities: this film and Red Cockroaches. And even Red Cockroaches made me look at ketchup differently.<br /><br />The script is horrible. It is obvious from reading the liner notes of the DVD that the writer/director changed the script on the fly (including the addition of the silly twist ending), probably after a late night session bulls^H^H^H^H^Hbrainstorming with the actors. It is even more obvious from watching it (\"a Dr Who scene? sure!\").<br /><br />The dialogue is horrible. People don't talk that way. Boyd Rice delivers monologues that sound as if he is reading from one of his own articles. I'm sure these were intended to be socratic dialogues (especially since they reference the concept, albeit poorly), but they managed to sound even *more* contrived than that, impossible as it sounds. And the attempts at slang? Ouch. Painful embarrassment for the character.<br /><br />The acting is horrible. The only one of any note was Daniel's partner Paul; he may not be able to carry a movie on his own, but standing next to Boyd Rice made him look like John-friggin-Malkovich. Once again, reading the liner notes made it apparent that the director knows/idolizes Boyd Rice, to the point where he was unable to give good direction (if he had it) to an actor. Stilted, wooden, monotonic moments are what we get. Keanu would be proud.<br /><br />The violence is poor. Maybe a viewing of Doom Generation is in order. It *is* possible to do good violence with a low budget. Simply firing guns (most of which were poor, though Paul's revolver was actually a quality piece) and splattering red paint around doesn't do it. Unless of course you're talking TROMA, where violence isn't actually the point.<br /><br />I cannot continue this review without addressing the terms 'controversy' and 'artistic integrity'. There is nothing controversial about this movie. The views expounded upon (at great tedious length) are not original or unique; they have been gracing the pages of zines and books from the fine folks at loompanics, paladin press, and the anarchist bookstore in SF for DECADES. In the course of my checkered literary past I have encountered these same arguments and views repeated ad nauseum.<br /><br />I'm sure the director and actor both hold these opinions as their own -- that's patently obvious from the ham-fisted way they were inserted into the plot(?), and the lackluster delivery (i.e., it's not an actor making you believe they believe this, but a believer droning on and on about their religion with no regard for their listener). I do believe they thought they were casting pearls before swine in the making of this film. But that does not make the opinions original, controversial, well-thought-out, appealing to any but the most philosophically naive, or indeed anything but what they are: a reactionary position against the established order which would not succeed on its own merits and thus must actively strive to emphasize its difference and novelty.<br /><br />To paraphrase Tom Stoppard's play The Real Thing, which actually treats the subject of watching a work such as this quite well, \"Making a bad film is no proof of integrity\".<br /><br />What makes a good movie? Interesting characters. A compelling script. Convincing acting. Natural dialogue. Incredible cinematography. A sense of mood or atmosphere.

I've never had a long shot finish in the money, and thanks to Daddy Day Care,I still haven't had the big one come in.<br /><br />Unless you're a brain dead zombie from Night of The Living Dead, you know what the plot of this movie is going to be before the $8.50 even leaves your hand for the movie ticket. That's not a problem because that's the way it is with most films these days, especially formula comedies. If they give you a snappy script with funny dialogue, tolerable acting, characters you can care about, and enough humorous moments so that you don't miss that $8.50, then any film can make the grade. I don't think having those elements are too much to ask for, but the people involved in Daddy Day Care sure must think so.<br /><br />Very early in this film they give us Jeff Garlin and Steve Zahn dressed as broccoli and a carrot, so that they can promote some kind of vegetable flavored cereal. The whole premise is so idiotic, that I'm thinking how could this be funny? As it turns out, I'm right, and just as I am predicting that the kids will turn on Garlin and Zahn in their tossed salad outfits then begin throwing things and attacking the vegetables, it happens on the screen. If you think your kids hate vegetables now, you'll never get them in the little tykes after they see this nonsense. Not one minute, not one second, not one millisecond of this is remotely funny. To top it off, I'm now in a sour mood as I think of the $8.50 I once had, and the almost ten dollars I had spent on popcorn and soda. I'm thinking there's still a chance Daddy Day Care can recover and get better.<br /><br />Of course, Murphy Zahn and Garlin, are soon fired, so out of financial necessity, they start Daddy Day Care. Now at this point, we start getting the fish out of water story, and our hopes are high that the fun will now begin. It doesn't. We know the kids are going to start out by giving Murphy and Garlin a hard time. There should be some funny gags here, but there isn't. The kids are annoying and Murphy and Garlin do nothing more than stand around as targets for their shenanigans. What is worse, they feed the kids a bunch of ding dongs, making them run around aimlessly even more, getting into more things and being more obnoxious than ever, and not doing it in any way to suggest the slightest taste of humor. To top it off, we get to see the kid can't hit the potty scene which was in all the previews. Believe me folks, it played better as a coming attraction then it does here. Come to think of it, the whole bit was in the trailer so what you saw is what you get. <br /><br />Later, when Steve Zahn finally returns to help the guys out with their Day Care, does the audience finally chuckle for the first time since they sat down to watch this turkey. He's the best thing going in this movie, but isn't used nearly enough. All the rest of the goings on you can guess: the boys will learn to do better, the kids will like them, more parents will bring their kids, blah blah blah. Only when Zahn is on the screen does any of this play out with any sense of comedy.<br /><br />Anjelica Houston, who should know better by now, plays the villain running a competing day care center. I think she is trying to play it in such a way so that we think it is campy enough for there to be humor in her performance. We can laugh while we hate her. We don't laugh, and we don't hate her, because we just don't care.<br /><br />Daddy Day care does try to redeem itself toward the end and show that it has somewhat of a heart. It is way too little, way too unfunny, and way too late to salvage this romper room rubbish. If you must watch a fish out of water story about kids, I suggest you head to your nearest store and pick up Kindergarten Cop. Shwarzenegger and the kids are much funnier and Arnold's not even suppose to be a comedienne. Come to think of it though, judging from has last couple of movies, Eddie Murphy is no longer a comic or an actor. What a waste!", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 9353, "text": "David Cronenberg is up there with David Lynch as one of the top visual surrealist directors. Whilst The Fly is not a surreal like Eraserhead or Naked Lunch, it has its surreal moments and definitely crosses the boundaries in to shock cinema. Cronenberg is a director who has an obvious fascination with the grotesque there are not many more grotesque images than some shown here. The make up used on Jeff Goldblum is brilliant and changes very subtly during Brundle's transformation from man to Brundlefly. To witness the final stages of Brundlefly is particularly disturbing and Geena Davis' reactions mirror exactly how I felt when watching with disbelief. The visuals in this film, although slightly over the top, are fantastic and will never be forgotten. Cronenberg is fantastic as a director because rather than being concerned with making the film accessible, he cares more for making a good film and projecting his vision.<br /><br />As well as being highly imaginative and impressive visually, The Fly has a great plot. The relationship between Goldblum and Davis is very touching and romantic. The relationship is written very effectively due to it being exaggerated to the point that the audience are prepared to believe that this woman will still love a genetically mutating man. The main plot of an inventor creating 'telepods' that accidentally become gene fusers gives the film its Sci-Fi element and the way Goldblum's character transforms after he goes through is very commendable. Whilst not the most thought provoking of plots, The Fly is intelligently written and does well to both entertain and shock.<br /><br />Goldblum does fantastically in making the leap from an eccentric, somewhat childlike scientist to a mutant going crazy. He is perfect for this role in appearance, by voice and by him mannerisms. Jeff Goldblum makes Seth Brundle a unique character and definitely should be the role Goldblum is most proud of playing. Geena Davis is a great actress and does very well in this performance. Her ability at showing shock and disgust is very good but it is the more subtle parts involving her and Goldblum's character development where she really shines.<br /><br />The dark mood of the film is greatly reflected by the atmosphere in the film. Most of the settings are very dark and there are not many characters in the film, helping the audience to focus on Goldblum and Davis. Howard Shore's score is extremely dramatic, slightly cliché but very well done. Cronenberg is an expert at creating moods and contrast. The contrast of a wonderful romance against all the grotesque imagery is very effective as it brings an element of reality to the film. There is also a sense of abruptness to the film; the abrupt ending reflects how quickly the fly's genes fused with Brundle's body. It is the subtle themes that really make this film standout.<br /><br />A classic Sci-Fi Horror, The Fly is a great film and stands proud with many science fiction films of the 80s. The eighties is often mocked as a cultural phenomenon but with regards to this specific genre, the eighties was an immensely important decade. The Fly, along with Terminator, Aliens and The Thing went to great lengths to revolutionise the genre. Cronenberg does a fantastic job with this film. Of all of his more mainstream films, The Fly is his best effort yet.", "sentiment": 0}

Most of the script is garbage and it does no justice either to the original Gawain and the Green Knight poem or to Chrétien de Troyes' Ywain (or Owain). However, it's far from being the worst movie ever made, and latent somewhere in the badness there is at least an acceptable adventure film. Or might be.<br /><br />I mean, the film looks pretty good (it was shot by Freddie Young) and benefits from the use of real castles instead of fake-looking sets. And Connery's Green Knight is quite a sight. His costume has received a lot of scorn, yet I find it impressive. Sir Sean is aware of being in a bad movie and just has fun with his supervillain part (remember when he used to do so instead of his non-acting nowadays?), which is the best role in the film, and transmits said fun to the audience.<br /><br />I wish director Stephen Weeks would take back and recut the film. He'd have a lot of work to do, yet he could come up with something decent (apparently a lot of footage was cut, maybe part of it is worthwhile, maybe not). I would actually like Mr. Weeks to read this comment and think about it, maybe for a future DVD edition to replace the indefensible MGM Pan and Scan botch job from 2004 (If anyone reading this can contact Mr. Weeks, please feel free to pass these lines to him). Here's a list of what should be cut:<br /><br />-As much silliness as possible. That awful, childish and really unfunny humor is what really sinks the movie and turns it into a retarded cousin of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\". Gone should be the toilet jokes, the goofy fights, the \"Don't you see I'm playing\" moment with Rhys-Davies, the inept sidekick who kills the wrong knight... You get the idea.<br /><br />-All scenes featuring Morgan La Fay. Not only the character serves no purpose in the story, but she looks terribly anachronistic (notice the painted fingernails, not to mention her circus tent) and her scene with Connery makes the Green Knight appear less majestic, less supernatural and less powerful. And her toad form is just ridiculous. Get rid of all that and make the fight against the Black Knight the first of Gawain's adventures.<br /><br />-The fight scene with the Black Knight's empty armor. Hey, it's 2005 now, there's no longer need to shamelessly rip \"The Empire Strikes Back\" off, is there? Plus, it features the aforementioned toad.<br /><br />-The epilogue. It was the most \"huh?\" coda ever to a film until the live-action \"Dungeons & Dragons\" (a movie that, unlike this one, has absolutely zero redeeming features) came along.<br /><br />-There's nothing to do about the casting of Miles O'Keeffe as Gawain or his pathetic wig, but at least a couple of shots where he makes an awful ape-like face (one of them during the fight against Ronald Lacey) should disappear.<br /><br />-Contrary to popular opinion, I do like parts of the music score (particularly the main theme and the one in the scene where Gawain re-encounters Linet, which gets reprised at the end of the closing credits). However, I do think it should be re-orchestrated, to make it sound less computerized and low-budget, and add spectacularity to the images. Still, it's better than your average James Horner...<br /><br />I realize that the excision of these elements would not make a masterpiece out of this baby. Yet, complete with the possible reinsertion of any worthwhile cut scenes that could exist, it might become an entertaining adventure movie with good pacing (which currently, at 102 minutes, it totally lacks), not boring, not intelligence-insultingly silly, and worth watching for any medieval buffs such as myself. Unfortunately, in its current form, yes, it pretty much sucks. 3/10.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 41435, "text": "Of all the cardinal sins in cinema, boring an audience to tears is perhaps the most fatal, and \"Lady Chatterley\" is guilty on all counts.<br /><br />Based on D.H. Lawrence's novel Lady Chatterley's Lover, this French version, complete with exhaustive subtitles, tells the story of Lady Constance Chatterley (Marina Hands). Though vastly wealthy and living on an expansive estate, Lady Chatterley is unhappy; her husband, Sir Clifford (Hippolyte Girardot), rendered paraplegic during the Great War, is incapable of fathering any children. Much of Lady Chatterley's time is spent taking care of her invalid husband, socializing with her rich friends and family, and doing light chores around the house. Life continues in silent desperation until she first lays eyes upon the ruggedly handsome grounds keeper, Parkin (Jean-Louis Coullo'ch).<br /><br />Visually, \"Lady Chatterley\" is an artistic masterpiece. Whether it is a flower gently bobbing in the wind, the Lady Chatterley drinking from a spring, or Sir Clifford pottering about in his motorized wheelchair, there is always something beautiful to look at. \"Lady Chatterley\" even makes a brief segue into cinéma vérité, replacing the crisp, smooth steady camera with a hand-held 35mm, replete with washed-out color and uneven focus, making it look as if we were watching a home movie of her life.<br /><br />The acting was also quite remarkable. Even before they first consummate their love, it is quite evident that Lady Chatterley and Parkin want each other. Sir Clifford's own inner anger comes through quite well, knowing that he can't perform for his wife in the way she'd like, but still refusing to let her go completely. While he allows her to get pregnant by another man, Sir Clifford insists that the man with whom she copulates be someone he approves of, though in the end she never reveals to him who her true lover is.<br /><br />Of course, there comes a point where visual wonderment, intense emotions and deep, important symbolism become too much. Half the scenes contain very little dialogue conducive to the plot, and where there is something to be said, it is constantly broken up by vast pauses drenched in meaning. The director also felt that some sequences could be cut entirely, replaced instead by the all-knowing Voice-over from God. If used properly, voice overs can be useful to the story- here, the voice-over is little more than a giant \"up yours\" to the viewer.<br /><br />There is very little reason to see this movie. The acting, visuals and cinematography are all incredible and surpass the quality of most recently released movies, but at just under three hours, it is just too long. Had the director cut out an hour and a half's worth of extra material, unnecessary sequences and needlessly artistic shots to give us a bare-bones story of Lady Chatterley and her lover, or simply told the story better, he might have made something one could actually care about. Those familiar with the frankly erotic nature of the source material, hoping the love scenes may add some extra \"oomph\" to an otherwise dry romp will be sorely disappointed. At its high point, the two lovers go for an unnecessarily long frolic in the rain, culminating flowers laced about their nether regions.<br /><br />Instead of a tight romance between forbidden lovers, we get three hours of walking around large French estates and rich people frittering away their afternoons. 2 of 5", "sentiment": 0}

The writing is often achingly 'cute', with hardly a wink to the audience to let us know co-writer Segal is in on the joke, but the more thoughtful moments (which are integrated unobtrusively by director Richard Lang) offer some insight into what breaks up a marital union, and both MacLaine and Hopkins have strong scenes. ** from ****", "sentiment": 0}

However, it takes a greater person to admit when they were wrong and give credit when it is due, and it most certainly due. If one really wanted to, they could pick apart the historical accuracy of the film, or the tactics, or the costuming, or the geography; I am sure that such people could easily find some justification for condemning this film.<br /><br />On the other hand, what would follow would be a trite listing of errors and complaints, tarted up with clever comments and sealed with some witty remark. Is that what proper film critique is about? It doesn't take much in the way of intelligence to attack and destroy what you see before you. That is why people do it so easily and without thought. In a way, this film touches on that very human failing. So many film goers and critics (professional and armchair) are going to dismiss this film as if it is some plague carrier, and only because of the name that goes with it. I feel sorry for those people because they will miss out on a great many interesting and even inspiring film experiences in their life time.<br /><br />Tunnel Rats is one such experience. It is a small production and done very succinctly and without much extraneous posturing. From the first scene, the film gets right down to business and doesn't really let up until the gripping and downright mortifying ending. Perhaps it is the small size of the production that has kept Boll honest somewhat. I can imagine that when contracted to make Hollywood films, there is a lot of pressure to appeal to the attention deficit audiences out there, often the very ones that hate him, and therefore he aims too far above his mark.<br /><br />In this film he hits the mark very confidently and professionally. It is worth seeing this film, and doing so without preconception or judgment. Boll is just the director and a film is a sum of its parts, even though Boll directed this film, there were dozens of earnest and hardworking actors and crew members putting in their all to make this film. It is the hight of arrogance to laugh at their efforts and belittle what they made when truly there is nothing really wrong with it.<br /><br />I hope that enough people are see this film so that Boll can keep doing what he enjoys and sharing it with people.

She speaks more in her silences, stares and glances than with words. She was the perfect casting by the Director Sam.

{"id": 15124, "text": "With the possible exceptions of BRIGHTON ROCK and GET CARTER,\"The Long Good Friday\" has a strong case in being the best British gangster film yet produced.It thankfully lacks the jokey,facetious and overtly bloody attitudes that has plagued most UK-based hybrids since the 1990's (as personified by Guy Ritchie and others).It's occasional lapses into nastiness and schematic excesses are easily outweighed by an excellent script (which possesses considerable caustic wit),fine direction,great performances and memorable scenes.<br /><br />Gangland boss Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) is on the verge of something big in his native London's docklands;replacing the declining port-side areas with vast new modern developments and buildings,even with a view to holding a future Olympic Games there.There is however a considerable fly in the ointment;would-be mafia backers are concerned as Harold's manor and underlings are subjected to a campaign of murder and bombings,later revealed to be the work of the IRA,who think Shand was responsible for the deaths of several of their members (when in fact he wasn't).An enraged Harold plans his revenge,but should he go ahead and do so?<br /><br />The basic plot of \"The Long Good Friday\" is perhaps the film's only real weak point.In it's favour,it is certainly unusual but often somewhat over-complicated (several viewings may be needed to properly connect all it's threads) and a little far-fetched;the fact it is set around Easter (Ireland has had some very important events occurring around this holiday period throughout it's long history) may be intended irony.But in the midst of the considerable quality around it,these are modest complaints.John McKenzie's direction (what a shame his subsequent work has been much lower profile) is very well-judged,being either fast,exciting,subtle or reflective when the situation demands it,serving the thoughtful,literate,clever,often droll script by Barrie Keeffe.The characters are not the familiar stereotypes you'd expect in such gangster dramas,and performers like Bryan Marshall,Alan King and Eddie Constantine (in a rare English-speaking part) are given slightly more depth to roles that could have been mere ciphers.Helen Mirren is first class as Harold's mistress,one of the most interesting gangster's molls ever put on screen,but the entire film is dominated by the career defining performance of Bob Hoskins.His searing,commanding presence as Shand is outstanding,carrying conviction in every moment.Hoskins' portrayal is arguably the most anti of anti-heroes in cinematic history.Harold Shand thinks himself as a businessman and no longer a criminal with the 1980's about to loom,with apparent peace with rival gangs for a decade further emphasising this point.But with the uncontrollable mayhem taking place around him threatening his legitimate credentials,Harold is more than prepared to dish out some extremely brutal (if not sado-masochistic) treatment to find those responsible so the lucrative deal can go forward,making cynical,hypocritical remarks about the decline of various neighbourhoods along the way.<br /><br />With the exception of a brief view of Tower Bridge near the beginning,director MacKenzie does not fall into the trap of familiar tourist views but less known London back streets and perhaps the last real view of the UK capital's somewhat neglected docklands in the pre-Thatcherite/Yuppie era in the late 70's/early 80's before it's redevelopment,Canary Wharf and all. This aspect of the plot turned out to be fascinatingly prophetic and accurate (if in a slightly different context),along with hopes for a London-staged Olympic Games.What with his desire for enterprise and virulent hate for Irish Republicans,it is no surprise that the character of Harold Shand could be perceived as a hero with certain right-wing types in Britain! Hoskins in fact often makes this most unpleasant of characters sympathetic (with some witty one-liners part of his repertoire) in the midst of similarly unsavoury individuals.His grotesque arrogance and megalomania however get the better of him when he somehow thinks he can take on the even more ferocious and brutal elements within the IRA.He is warned of the risks by one of his closest associates,fresh-faced Jeff (who is killed by Harold in a savage outburst) but to no avail.The irony of course,is that Harold himself did not instigate this chaos;it the aforementioned Jeff and one of his most trusted friends and associates,Colin,a homosexual,who fell prey to the dual temptations of sex and money while in Belfast (doing an errand without Shand's knowledge or approval),placing Harold's business plans in dire jeopardy.<br /><br />The support cast has many future TV and Film stars who turn up every few minutes:Gillian Taylforth,Paul Freeman,Dexter Fletcher,Paul Barber,Karl Howman and Derek Thompson among them.The most notable of all is Pierce Brosnan,in a one word role as a IRA hit-man.It is Brosnan who appears with Hoskins in the film final and most memorable scene.The infamous abattoir sequence (with Shand's rival gang members hung upside down on meat hooks) is unforgettably horrifying and darkly funny,along with Harold's apocalyptic rage after finding out of the IRA's campaign against him. But the final drive away,with Brosnan holding Hoskins at gunpoint is now justly famous,holding on Harold's face seemingly endlessly but ingeniously,with all number of expressions telling us so much.This aspect of Hoskins' performance may be it's most impressive,despite being wordless.There has been a problem in some of Bob Hoskins' film roles since;undeniably a very fine actor,Hoskins however has sometimes fallen into the speech patterns and mannerisms of the role that made him a star into some other parts he has played,much to his detriment,though this has mostly been the exception rather than the rule.<br /><br />In retrospect,\"The Long Good Friday\" has a lot to answer for;many other British filmmakers have followed it's example for nearly three decades in mostly resistible imitations,but the original has not dated much at all and is still superior to the virtually all of it's prototypes.<br /><br />RATING:8 out of 10.", "sentiment": 0}

One of the most stupid thing he does is to put as much blood and gore into a story that didn't contain any of it in the first place. Towards the end, the violence reaches an almost parodic amount. Don't misunderstand me, I don't find violence offensive or something, but here it was wrong to use, although Argento usually makes gory movies. Also, the whole concept of the Phantom being raised by rats, and having a face without scars was extremely dumb.<br /><br />The cast is another factor to point a finger at. Dario Argento should not have cast his daughter to play such a role, as this seems pretty incestuous. Julian Sands was also terribly misplaced as the Phantom, and didn't fit in at all. Nadia Rinaldi was the only cast-member who was any fun at all. I think I found her character funny, mostly because of her rather disgusting appearances and behavior. The best word to describe the acting is: terrible!<br /><br />Basically every aspect of this movie sucked, and the reason I'm not giving it a 1, is because of the occasionally good sets.", "sentiment": 0}

The gist of reviews is that this is a pale comparison, which doesn't mean much.<br /><br />I remember before it premiered, the buzz was mostly questioning whether the US was ready for such an \"unpleasant\" central character. I found Fitz pleasantly realistic and not nearly so obnoxious as the press indicated. The show has a great deal more depth than much of what's on, plus a large dose of simple everyday realism compared with most current dramas (where's Bochco when he's needed?)<br /><br />Currently there seem to be two schools of drama; both rather irritating: In one, focus on characters is maximized but events are somehow super-heightened as to be unreal. Kind of soaps on steroids that grind you down after a while: i.e. Grey's Anatomy<br /><br />The other is the gimmick show, started by ER, which focuses so heavily on it's supposedly clever concept, usually some scientific subject usually just off the radar of common folk, the characters are virtually forgotten; mere robots carrying on the activity necessary to illustrate the subject: Any of the CSI's, Criminal Minds, Numbers, Lie To Me, and a few dozen others they've spawned.<br /><br />Cracker was not clichéd. It was character driven without forgetting to have interesting goings on, and didn't try to twist the viewer into knots with every plot turn.<br /><br />Fitz reminds me quite a bit of Dr. House, especially now that show has lost it's sense of humor as well as the cast and formula that made it great. Cracker was never as brilliant as House began, but then there's plenty of room for both sorts. Perhaps the character of Fitz WAS before the time was right.", "sentiment": 0}

Then came the IRA (for us Brits ) and the Russians . Sinister foe's who were willing to go that one step further for their cause. Since 9/11 a far more fearful enemy has appeared on the scene. A brain washed enemy that is willing to die in the name of religion - The fundamentalist Muslims . Because of the terrifying prospect of what they have done and what they could do again , Hollywood have jumped on the band wagon and profited from a string of movies about the subject . None of which have been outstanding yet most have been entertaining. Traitor fits perfectly in that bracket .<br /><br />When straight arrow FBI agent Roy Clayton heads up the investigation into a dangerous international conspiracy, all clues seem to lead back to former U.S. Special Operations officer, Samir Horn. A mysterious figure with a web of connections to terrorist organizations, Horn has a knack for emerging on the scene just as a major operation goes down.<br /><br />The inter-agency task force looking into the case meets with Carter,a veteran CIA contractor who seemingly has his own agenda and Max Archer, fellow FBI agent. The task force links Horn to a prison break in Yemen, a bombing in Nice and a raid in London, but a tangle of contradictory evidence emerges, forcing Clayton to question whether his quarry is a disaffected former military operative--or something far more complicated.<br /><br />Obsessed with discovering the truth, Clayton tracks Horn across the globe as the elusive ex-soldier burrows deeper and deeper into a world of shadows and intrigue.<br /><br />I like Don Cheadle. I can forgive him for one of the worst ever English accents in the Ocean's films because despite that he is normally very good at his trade. He was brilliant in Boogie Nights and i loved his performance Reign Over Me. His performance is probably the best thing about Traitor. <br /><br />Although thoroughly entertaining , this film has nothing new in it to recommend it any more than say - The Kingdom or Body of Lies - and if you have seen either of those films you have seen Traitor.<br /><br />It's good to see Guy Pearce too . A highly underrated actor who has hardly put a foot wrong since his days in the extremely naff Australian Soap Opera \"Neighbours\". His best performance to date being the lead in the stunning movie \"Momento\". <br /><br />This film reminds me a lot of the US TV series \" Sleeper Cell\" .

{"id": 2578, "text": "... In the rarely seen Icelandic movie A Man Like Me, the audience will laugh out loud amid the breakdown and aftermath of the relationship. The 2002 film is director Robert Douglas's most commercially successful. He also met his future wife, a Chinese-born woman, on the set. But the film is refreshingly free of Orientalist clichés, perhaps because the leading woman's character was originally conceived as a Pole. Douglas tells the Global Times that filmmakers decided to cast the role with a Hong Kong actress Stephanie Che so could widen the commercial appeal of the film. Douglas said they also wanted to visit a more exotic location than Poland. In the opening scene, the main character reveals on a televised dating show that his longest ever relationship ended after just three months when he found a used prophylactic in his bed. The waitresses at his regular Chinese restaurant where he often eats tease him about being famous. Júlli agrees to help paint the house of the main love interest, Qi, and he meets her daughter. A montage of syrupy moments backed by a romantic songs shows the couple falling in love. This scene is a homage to cheesy Hong Kong romantic comedies, Douglas says. Júlli asks Qi to marry him, and in a twist, she says no, asking him if he thinks she needs a visa. Júlli is devastated, and the two stop talking. To cheer up, Júlli quits his job, gets a new haircut and clothes, and starts selling a health supplement as part of a pyramid scheme. He fails miserably. The only customer is his father, a musician with a single hit record twenty years before that won a \"Silver Cassette\" for selling 2,500 copies. The father dreams of representing Iceland in the annual Eurovision music contest. Qi returns to China to care for her sick mother, and Júlli follows, intending to profess his love for her. When he arrives at her village in Guangdong, he sees her with her ex-husband, and returns home in despair. The film ends with Júlli and Qi having a chance meeting. They have a pleasant formal conversation, and promise to meet again for coffee. Neither of them acknowledge the fact that she is many months pregnant. Júlli's father, meanwhile, gets rich selling the nutritional supplement to U.S. soldiers based in Iceland and has a second rise to fame, representing Iceland in the Eurovision competition....

What really makes the film interesting is the appearance of William Shatner who plays a marine biologist at the park! The clothes he wears is enough to make watching the movie worthwhile.

{"id": 40205, "text": "After renting this out of curiosity, and overall, wasting a very long 90 minutes out of my life, I feel like I need to comment on this. Keep in mind, this is a fair critique, nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />First off, I am not one to just get a movie based on the cover art. I read the back cover, and even though Joey Lawrence of Blossom fame (if you could call it that) was in it, I decided to give it a try, just for once, to pick a movie, that might be one of those that might just surprise me in being a good movie. This one wasn't at all. The cover of the box is, however, very well done in that in portrays a good movie (unfortunately, this movie is not inside the box). Though, to bash it would be senselessly in the same vein as the same mockeries you hear elsewhere of such B-movies. Oh, this one has all of the complaints of a non-fun B-movie (keep in mind, B-movies, in my opinion, can be really fun to watch), but, there is something about it that sets it apart from my 1 and 2 star ratings on this site. But before I get to that rationale, first the obvious complaints. The dialogue is horrible. The plot is just stupid. For a horror movie it is not at all scary. But, and I know, I am biting my tongue saying this, the acting wasn't that bad. I've seen a lot worse. As for the direction, it really wasn't that bad either, believe it or not. Though still amateurish, any attempts of a B-movie being 'stylish' differentiates it from a movie shot with a home video camera, and that is okay in my book, at least in that respect. From what I gathered, they picked a bunch of better than average-talented no-name, yet, attractive actors to star in this, spent the time to throw in some (keep in mind, the word here is 'some') snazzy direction, and some decent music and lighting. Trust me, to be fair, I've seen a lot worse. It looked like everyone involved wanted to make something out of this movie, but, despite many other flaws, the script has to be the biggest. Though, it wasn't as stupid as others I've witnessed on the screen (there are a couple, surprisingly crude jokes that are somewhat amusing...at least they're right with the times, that's all I'll say), it still had way too many groaners, and was way too predictable. I'll give the cast credit with what they had to work with, I know amateurs when I see them, and at least half of the cast ain't that. The dialogue is just stupid, and the situations, man, how lame. But, the thing that bothered me the most was the characters...most were lame as could be. So lame that there were a couple that you wanted to see die horrible deaths, yet, this never happens. What we get is a movie that isn't a horror film, isn't a suspense or thriller, isn't much of a teen comedy...what it is is simply, perhaps an idea that sounded good on the drawing board, but completely failed upon execution. These 90 minutes felt like hours upon hours, and when it ends, it is completely ass-nine.<br /><br />Yeah, I didn't like this movie, but to call it complete crap would be unfair. It is crap, mind you, but, it is better than a lot I have seen over the years. Like I said, the acting, for a few of the characters was pretty good. But, unfortunately, that doesn't make up for a boring movie that will drain 90 minutes of your life that you will never ever get back. This isn't even one to get drunk and make fun of (i.e. one of those it is so bad it is good movies) b\\c it takes itself so seriously, when it should know that the audience, given the cast and the non-mass produced title, has already given it two strikes against it. In my opinion, if a horror movie gets confused halfway through what it wants to do, becoming a slasher flick, though cheap (and I sure as hell ain't bashing slasher flicks, they're the most fun to make fun of), at least it can be entertaining. But no, there are no deaths or anything in this film, just stupid, pick up lines and improbable situations with too many characters who I wanted to see be vanquished due to their lameness. I give it a 3/10 stars, and that's pushing it. That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.", "sentiment": 0}

It was so surprising when I first saw it, that at first, I didn't even know what it was.<br /><br />Once again, the Coens have created wonderful characters, including Clooney, who is a womanizer and paranoid that people are following him, and McDormand, who just wants plastic surgery in order to look better. Also, there's John Malkovich as Osbourne Cox, who \"doesn't have a drinking problem,\" and maybe the best in the movie, Brad Pitt as Chad, a clueless gym employee who is pushed along by McDormand.<br /><br />The only character that isn't up to par with the rest is Tilda Swinton's character of Katie Cox, Osbourne's wife. She doesn't get as many laughs as the rest, and it seems like the Coens just needed her as a plot device rather than an actual character. However, she may not be funny, but she does play the character well.<br /><br />The writing is brilliant and the Coens weave the story in such a way that it reminds me of their previous movie, The Big Lebowski. In the end, as J.K. Simmons character sums it up himself, nothing really happens, but while watching it all unfold, you can't help but laugh at the absurdity.", "sentiment": 0}

Living in a time vastly different to our own, Cromwell sought guidance from God in everything he did. He was also a highly skilled and dedicated leader of men. To suggest that he would randomly shoot someone in the street is frankly an insult. He was subject to severe mood swings, possibly even manic depression but remained an honourable man.

Inevitably, no one will ever match it, but to think Gwyneth Paltrow won the same award for her role in \"Shakespeare in Love\" is laughable.<br /><br />Kevin Kline is brilliant as the chilling yet endearing Nathan, whilst Peter MacNicol is the character whose superb narration and acting transmits us into the movie.<br /><br />I noticed that the morose Pauline Kael, the most ludicrously over-respected film critic of all time, once again shows her cynicism in finding much fault with the movie: I will have none of it: it is utterly moving, without having to resort to cliché or overloud, haunting music to influence our emotions.

The actors playing the main roles tried hard but Charles came out looking like a social misfit (seemingly the only woman who took to him, according to this film, were Lady Diana and Camilla--actually he had serious relationships). Camilla comes out looking like a tea and sympathy type (what about it dearie) who takes Charles in and has a long term relationship with him. The actress playing Diana is a total miscast. All she has is the hairdo, but she cannot convey or channel Diana. For one thing, she is quite wooden, too mature for the part of a starry eyed nineteen year old and the other she is all wrong physically and facially for the part. Charles towers over her which is quite jarring. In reality, Charles and Diana were about the same height, she being quite tall. There are factual errors, the most blatant being when Camilla tells Charles Princess Caroline is a prospect and probably still a virgin (this takes place in Fall 1979 when Caroline was married about a year to Philippe Junot). Also, Charles' other significant other Lady Kanga is completely left out; she had a major role in his life around the seventies and early eighties.

When trying to uncover evidence to clear his name, Jerry he finds out that 10 years ago, a group of people from the same college Stanford University have taken a new form of LSD called Blue Sunshine, which now has suddenly caused them to lose their hair and change into homicidal maniacs.<br /><br />Hook, line and sinker it totally took me by surprise and made me sit up. This rewarding flick that's a very groovy slice of the 70s. Has become a cult film over the years and has been on my must-see list for ages. I was livid when I eventually came across it. Director/writer Jeff Lieberman (his debut as a director) delivered in what he set out to achieve in 'Blue Sunshine' and I wasn't disappointed in what I got, at all. He comes up with an effective and energetic shocker, that sets itself out by the excellent performances from a cast of mainly no-names (with the exception of Zalman King) and a original story, which seems to get better the more it moves along. Don't be expecting a fully loaded horror film, with gore and horror throughout. It's rather a psychological, sophisticated mystery thriller that works in some decent surprises and jabs that are spine tingling good. There's such a nice balance in this slow grinder that just pulls you along for the intriguing, but disquieting ride with our protagonist. So it's basically a well-paced story that's more a mystery with dabs of horror themes, the material isn't too shocking but some of the violence is nasty or just plain maniac, but not overly graphic. The most startling scene in the film would have to be the opening killing and some implied violence or I should call it the aftermath of a murder spot in house mid-way through the flick will cause a tingle. Crafted into it, is a tight script that doesn't sway of course, but sufficiently adds to the bigger picture.<br /><br />For a low-budget production is stands up remarkably well and it's rather sad it's gone by with little impact, because Lieberman shows impressive talent here. The thick 70's vibe takes real control, but the cheesiness doesn't overshadow it, with a scene occurring in a groovy disco when a bald guy goes out of control because of the music. Which it's really making fun of the type of music in doing so? Although the score doesn't fall into that same fate as it's eerie as hell, by raising the hairs on your skin. These moments definitely added to the unsettling mood that's created and help build up those scenes with the bald psychopaths becoming rather freaky. Surely it would turn you off drugs! The camera-work was highly distinctive with its many shots. The only downside for me was the abrupt ending, but that's a minor squabble compared with the rest.<br /><br />Ultimately a satisfying shocker that hits all the right keys.

This leviathan from MGM piles on the lavish sets and costumes but manages to evoke little more than polite boredom mixed with the occasional snicker. There's no historical atmosphere here -- everything is \"soundstage\" -- and there's no chemistry between its leading man and leading lady.

This is puzzling inasmuch as he was a good-looking fellow with a fine voice and real acting talent but perhaps the cold, cynical nature of his two major roles kept audiences from warming to him. He soon wound up in Italian B-movies. The flogging he suffers while chained in a dungeon in \"The Prodigal\" did, however, win him a bit of unexpected honor. It ranks 66th in the book, \"Lash!

{"id": 40240, "text": "So the anti-Bush campaign that makes up the first 45 minutes or so of the movie are pretty clear. Even the attack on Bush's anti-gay tendencies are pretty clear. What's not clear is what the movie's trying to do. Jack is a corporate employee with serious potential who finds himself unemployed because of his refusal to ignore the massive corporate corruption with which he suddenly finds himself surrounded. So then he goes home to his fancy apartment, which he can no longer afford to maintain, and then has to deal with the torturous proposal of impregnating lesbians at $10,000 a piece.<br /><br />The most difficult endeavor that the movie takes on is in trying to make us believe that Jack was actually conflicted about all of this, and it fails miserably. There a nonsensical subplot about him still being upset about his ex-girlfriend, the lesbian who is bringing all of her lesbian friends to be impregnated by Jack, but only after her. <br /><br />Keep in mind that their breakup happened FOUR YEARS EARLIER, and not only was he belligerently furious to come home and find his sexy girlfriend having sex with another sexy woman, but he hasn't gotten over it four years later. They actually get into screaming arguments in the movie about this ancient history between themselves. <br /><br />I'm reminded of one of Julia Roberts' many great lines from Closer  \"What are you, 12?\"<br /><br />So while he's not busy acting like a junior high school kid who's heartbroken about some girl who cheated on him, he's having sex with whole lines of lesbians and trying to act like it's just hell to him. Please. At the risk of sounding like some typical jerk, for such a thing to be torturous to a man we need to have a real, real good reason for him to hate doing it, and still being upset about a relationship that ended nearly half a decade earlier isn't even close to reason enough.<br /><br />I can accept that the movie wants to suggest that this guy genuinely loved his girlfriend and truly feels like he has lost the love of his life, but let me tell you one thing. Showing a guy suffer through Every Man's Fantasy is not the way to do it. At all. Unless, of course, you have some ulterior political motive, but that's just not Spike Lee's style, right? Right? <br /><br />I won't spend much time talking about the ludicrous premise about the lesbians. Whether you've seen the movie or not, you probably already know all about it. The problem is that you also come into the movie already knowing what a socially and politically conscious filmmaker Spike Lee is. We know that he is going to be making political statements in the film, and some of them are clear while others are not, unless Spike has completely lost all sense of balance. There are scenes where it is increasingly obvious what social ills are being dealt with, such as the terrible scene where Jack has some wooden and massively unrealistic conversation with his friend, who is trying to make money donating sperm. It's a god-awful scene, but it's relatively clear what is being said. <br /><br />I could, of course, come up with some pretty solid theories about what is being said about the homosexual content of the film, how Jack the black man is forced to descend to that level, but it is such a gigantic portion of the film that it even overshadows that picture of Bush on the $3 bill at the end of the opening credits, and that's a difficult image to overshadow. Lee puts so much stock into the lesbians in this movie that it borders on low- grade soft porn. <br /><br />At one point in the movie, while bike riding together, Jack's brother gives him a bright, sparkling gem of advice  get a vasectomy and call it a day. Now, there are two things that could lead a man to give such advice to his brother. First, it could be because he's been having too much sex, or second, it could be because he's making ten thousand dollars at a time doing it. Either way, it's a good reason never to take advice from your brother again. Jack, of course, reacts by throwing a temper tantrum like an 8 year old kid, resulting in one of the great many scenes that made me want to put a pot over my head and start beating on it with a serving ladle. <br /><br />One of the biggest problems with the movie is that not only does it bore and irritate but it deliberately insults the audience. Granted, I didn't know a lot of the details about some of the homages that are made in the film, such as the XFL player that inspired the title of the film and the security guard who exposed the Watergate break-in and ruined his own life in the process. I can understand if Lee wants us to be aware of what he's talking about, but he literally stops his movie to put these stories up on billboards and then hits us over the head with them. <br /><br />By the end of the movie I was literally standing up, pacing back and forth I was so irritated and desperate for it to end. There are times when I wish I didn't have this determination to finish watching movies, even the abysmally terrible ones. <br /><br />The really sad thing about She Hate Me is that it isn't even not very good for a Spike Lee film, this is just a bad movie overall. It's almost weird to think that it was directed by the same man that directed true classics like Do The Right Thing, one of my all time favorite films. She Hate Me is Spike Lee's version of Spielberg's 1941, but worse.<br /><br />Much worse.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 12204, "text": "Many reviews here focus on whether you can suspend disbelief on Sean Penn's performance as a retarded/autistic man. Before going into that, I'll go out on a limb here and say that the mental defects were incidental to the plot, the real issue was how much love Sam (Penn's characte) has for his daughter, Lucy (played by Dakota Fanning). These performances are masterful, Penn really departs from his trouble maker persona in so many of his earlier movies and shows depth that I really didn't expect from him. This is a breakthrough movie for him, and shows a range far exceeding my expectations Dakota Fanning gives a remarkable performance (I want to see her in other roles). I'm not very familiar with the behaviors of mildly autistic/retarded people, but I did find the Sam character believable. I think part of the issue is the same phenomena as Forrest Gump, that is the genius of the actor comes through, so you have a \"brilliant idiot\" As the father of a young daughter, I could relate. Michelle Pfeiffer's character was O.K. but not really central to the plot (her acting was O.K. I guess, but not great). My wife found the intrusive nature of the way the social workers were portrayed compelling. Other review have compared this movie to Rain Man and Kramer vs. Kramer. I thought this movie was more powerful than Rain Man (which was also good) but I have not seek Kramer vs. Kramer so I cannot make that comparison.<br /><br />I gave the story a 9/10, but if your not a parent or don't like emotional movies you might give it a lower rating.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 32828, "text": "The first thing I thought after seeing this movie was \"How is this possible that 'The Believer' actually won a price at the Sundance Filmfestival????\"<br /><br />It's not that it's all bad, but it's not a movie I would call good. First, there are dozens of little errors. Especially in the beginning the editing is bad. Two times you get the feeling \"where am I?\" after a very quick cut to a scene somewhere else with the same characters. You get disoriented by it.<br /><br />Another error, when Danny vomits on the street, his girlfriend (who is actually not yet really his girlfriend) comes after him and french kisses him!! Man, that's gross! You just don't do that!<br /><br />The main character Danny, doesn't convince me either. Why did he become a skinhead? Okay, there's this explanation of banishment when he was a child, but I just don't see how you can choose for being a skinhead after that. And doesn't it seems slightly odd that although Danny has a huge collection of jewish items, knows hebrew by heart and doesn't want anyone to get close to the tora, and nobody seems to think, \"well, maybe he's jewish???\"<br /><br />Last but not least, there's the acting. Especially the flash-backs are very bad acted. The young Danny-boy tries to much and thinks he's as good as Haley Joel Osment. Furthermore, the older Danny tries a bit too hard to look like Edward Norton in American History X. I have to say, some of his looks sometimes work very well, but alas, most of the time they're just rip-offs.<br /><br />No, it really astonishes me that this movie won a prize.

The writing was terrible, the acting was even worse, and Jarman's directing was ridiculous. Jack Birkett who played the media mogul was definitely the WORST actor in the entire film and maybe gave one of the worse film acting jobs of all time. He had absolutely no idea what he was doing. The three main girls (Jordan, Nell Campbell, and Jenny whatever) were absolutely atrocious actors, I have NO idea why they were chosen. And they were ugly too (except maybe Jenny). Not enjoyable to watch any of them in the least. Adam Ant was okay at best, but ended up being the best actor in this 'movie'. <br /><br />Jubilee was trying to make some political/social statement making it, but in the end it just ended up as film rubbish. It was so ridiculously stupid it was laughable. There was stupid violence and killing that made no sense within any context. <br /><br />Also the film had a rather sexist view of women. I felt that it was trying to show what would happen if women end up taking over the world (especially having Elizabeth I (a powerful queen) go forward in time that was 'futuristic' when the movie was made right after the women's rights movement of the 60s). Basically, it would be a terrible world where no one would be able to 'control' the women so therefore they would end up going crazy, killing men, murdering police officers, getting naked at anytime, having sex with anyone, etc etc. Which was not a nice message and I did not appreciate it at all.<br /><br />I'm annoyed because I am in a 'New European Cinema' Class where we watch movies from 1970s on from Europe, and two of the kids in my class recommended it and my teacher let us watch it without even watching it herself. What a waste of class time, especially because there are so many better English movies, it's atrocious that she wasted our time.<br /><br />For a reason that I do now know, the last 1/5 of the movie got slightly better, but it was still way below mediocre film making. Basically 'better' means almost bearable. However, the last fifth (the last 20 minutes) and they isn't even good enough to bear watching this awful film.<br /><br />The premise was an interesting one (Queen of England goes ahead in time to see futuristic times) but Jarman completely failed at making a movie worth anyones time.

{"id": 4068, "text": "\"Die Hard\" is the prototype type for the modern action film. Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing. \"Die Hard\" is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since \"Die Hard\" was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of \"Die Hard\" . . . or, for that matter, is better than \"Die Hard\".<br /><br />\"Die Hard\" is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures. Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .<br /><br />Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim. The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over. There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out. (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, \"Die Hard\" is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written. McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action. A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, \"Die Hard\" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all. With \"Die Hard\", John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.<br /><br />As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect. Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane. As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure. There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero. Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism. The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant. (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.) There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber. The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route. Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero. He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand. Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains. As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good. Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual \"damsel in distress\" mold. It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero. The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.<br /><br />\"Die Hard\" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly. There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film. Is \"Die Hard\" one of the best overall movies ever made? Probably not. But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film. Grade: A", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 15714, "text": "This film is just begging for the tag 'Charmingly eccentric 30s romantic drama', complete as it is with Empire line dresses, stunning countryside locations and a whimsical, bickering family. However it's the performance of the divine Romola Garai, as the middle child Cassandra, that really makes this film work. Bereft of makeup and hair shorn to an unflattering bob, constantly scribbling in her diary, she is the embodiment of the intellectual teen; her capacity for articulating cascading emotions seeing her forming a passionate bond with the written word. But her ongoing contemplation of her madcap family is born of concern rather than self-obsession. In the absence of their mother, Cassandara has begun to shoulder some of the responsibility for her brother, precocious and emotionally catatonic father. Her burdens are increased rather than lessened with the arrival of a pair of rich Americans, and the romance that ensues. The way Garai indicates Charlotte's confused emotions - torn between different impulses that propel her towards being a daughter, a sister and a lover - is remarkable. While Garai occupies the center of the film, some of the other players shine in their roles, especially the always entertaining (and perpetually unclothed, yes, she's naked again here!) Tara Fitzgerald and the lovely Rose Byrne as Cassandra's elder sister Rose. The men fare less well. Bill Nighy is miscast as the reclusive writer father, and Henry Cavill as Casandara's would-be beau Stephen is leaden. The other failing of the film - which is really more of a backhanded compliment - is that I found myself wanting to know more about the family and see more of their infighting. The plot errs towards the romantic rather than the comic (OK, fair enough, that's what it sets out to do) but I found the end result a little disappointing. I haven't read Dodie Smith's novel so don't know whether the slightly muted tone is due to allegience to the original story. Overall though, \"I capture the castle\" is sweetly and undemandingly entertaining, and Romola Garai's vulnerability is intoxicating.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 12241, "text": "If u need some back for the claims I will make below, Ill tell u I have lived and studied in Thailand for 4 years, I have a Thai wife and I have known many bar-girls, some of whom do the job for a lack of a better choice BUT STILL OUT OF FREE CHOICE and some who don't even want to consider different choices because they are contempt with what they do. In Thai society prostitution is \"illegal\" but it has long roots and a strong frame in the history and culture, the job of a prostitute is considered a low one but they are still a completely accepted part of the society. The life some women, like the character \"pla\" in this document live is NORMAL for these people. Yes, it is not just good or bad but NORMAL here, no matter what we think of it in the west.<br /><br />I know the girls working in the bars as this one in the document are free to leave any time they want for another job. But they often don't want, because in this job they make 10 times the same money with less efforts. Any other job would decrease their living standards too much so they go for the money. <br /><br />I have lived and stayed with poor Thai people, who are not and don't want to be prostitutes. Thay are students or factory workers and I have stayed in their in lousy shacks and 8 square rooms eating the street food, and though I am not used to it and cant say I enjoy it, for them it is NORMAL and I know they have been contempt with what they have. The bar-girls are not contempt with that or they want to send more money home for the parents, or save up money so they go and sell themselves or just entertain some foreigners to get more money. <br /><br />So even if the choice is not good, there IS A CHOICE for everyone of them (in bars like the one featured in this film). Thats just a choice between a hard life with your pride or getting more money with less pride. Now to the point:<br /><br />This film is very sad indeed.<br /><br />Not because the \"story\" is sad but because sadly there is no story. Not because the filmatography or any other artistic feature is so convincing but because of the lack of anything convincing. Like others have pointed out here the director obviously had nothing together before shooting this poor film except average camera and editing skills and his prejudice and stereotypical view of the issue and what he would get together.<br /><br />And thats exactly what he tries to carry on to the viewer as well: he is asking the girl direct personal questions to get the answers he wants. What is supposed to look like \"caring about her problem\" or \"listening to her\" falls apart with his condescending attitude towards the culture and the girls profession and life. With the attitude, style and language the girl is interviewed with, she is not given an option or possibility to explain anything about her real thoughts.<br /><br />What has happened here is that the girl got annoyed with the film maker (I would have) and the film maker frustrated because the girl didn't answer what he expected. After his few weeks holiday in Thailand money ran out, the director packed his bags and went home with nothing. Thats the obvious reason for the fraud ending and the claimed \"murder\" of the girl, to get some drama, twist and an end to his story.<br /><br />If this serves as something, that is as an example of what document is not supposed to be. I can not believe this has actually been aired in full length on some self respecting network or station. A document is supposed to look at the real nature of things and openly present them to the viewer instead of reproducing old ideas and clichés, lying and controlling the subject to impose a wanted effect on them.

{"id": 30358, "text": "Frank A. Cappello, writer and director of He Was a Quiet Man, is a man with something to prove, having written the hilariously bad Hulk Hogan vehicle Suburban Commando, and directing the wholly disappointing Constantine. He Was a Quiet Man, whilst not an unqualified success, is one of the underseen gems of 2007.<br /><br />The film is essentially an amalgam of A History of Violence, Falling Down, and Office Space, with a pile of quirks to boot. Bob Maconel (the hilariously disguised Christian Slater), a despondent office worker, decides that he is going to perform a murderous rampage at his work office, yet before he can do so, a fellow maniac beats him to it. However, Bob, in protecting the one person that he cares about, the beautiful Vanessa (Elisha Cuthbert), guns down the assailant, and inadvertently becomes a hero.<br /><br />Bob is unashamedly similar to Michael Douglas' \"D-Fens\" character from Falling Down, kitted out in a shirt and tie, and even further, seeks moments of reflection in the great outdoors, although in this instance, there are no Mexican gangsters attempting to rob him. The similarities do, thankfully, stop there  this film is born of something else, with its CGI traffic whizzing by at astronomical speeds as Bob dawdles along, illustrating the drudgery of Bob's life without an ounce of subtlety. Whilst the film as a whole is overly reliant on visual curiosities such as this, the animated, talking fish which eggs Bob on to kill his colleagues is delightfully colourful, and mildly amusing to boot.<br /><br />As one can gather from the above paragraph, He Was a Quiet Man is very surreal in a hilarious sort of way. Essentially, if you gave David Lynch a funny bone, you'd probably end up with something remarkably similar to this. Despite the aforementioned reliance on visual effects, the film is unquestionably carried by the barely-recognisable Slater who, despite his recent collaboration with tragically awful director Uwe Boll, proves that he is still worth something in Hollywood, with comic timing that is nothing short of spot on.<br /><br />Bob is essentially revered by everyone around him for his \"heroic\" actions  he is given a new job, his colleagues no longer think of him as a schmuck, and the sexy office bitch wants to have sex with him, yet the film's real point of contention is Cuthbert's character. Vanessa is left paralysed following the shooting, wishing that she was dead, and moreover, she wishes that Bob, who saved her life, would kill her.<br /><br />A surprisingly understated (until the climatic scenes) conundrum surfaces as an aside to this drama  Bob still finds those around him utterly repugnant, and he considers whether or not to carry out what the other gunner started, as well as putting Vanessa out of her misery, of course. The film carries these questions very well  it is at times predictable, and occasionally not so, yet it never ceases to lose its sense of intrigue. The film's examination of the way in which humans operate is not intricate, and verges on syrupy at times, yet what is most entertaining about He Was a Quiet Man is its surreal spirit. Furthermore, even in its sweetness, the film explores the lives of disabled persons with a surprising level of insight and honesty . It may be exaggerated, and at times, even humorous, yet its approach is undeniably refreshing, particularly in relation to how the disabled manage to still engage in an active and healthy sex life.<br /><br />He Was a Quiet Man never remains comfortable, constantly fidgeting and posing new questions for both ourselves and Bob to consider. The film follows through with an insane close, yet it is the most manically reasoned, and therefore, perhaps the most realistic end possible (although term \"realism\" is a very tenuous one in a film as twisted as this). The ending comes very abruptly, and little is done to satisfy viewer curiosity, yet we are given the vital answers, even if they aren't wholly satisfying, and are a tad questionable. We are left to ponder several things, yet when the preceding ninety minutes are so intentionally devoid of poignance, the film may simply leave your mind as the final frame does.<br /><br />Christian Slater's latest and greatest effort (at least for a while) is A History of Violence without the graphic violence, Falling Down without the social commentary, and Office Space without the sagacious humour. Yes, it is a blend of all three films, at the cost of diluting each of them. The film's worst crime may be never allowing us to particularly care for Bob (or anyone) as much as we did for D-Fens in Schumacher's film, yet even despite its relative superficiality, He Was a Quiet Man remains a thoroughly entertaining, inventive and quirky film that will have nihilists the world over utterly dumbfounded (myself included). Elisha Cuthbert pulls out a career best (in that she is above tolerable, and even \"good\"), William H Macy plays the corporate yes-man with glee, and Slater, with great aid from his fabulous make-up department, looks and acts with great hilarity. It is unfortunate that this film, embracing its flaws as it so flagrantly does, has yet to find a large audience, and as such, it instantly becomes one of the indie staples of 2007.", "sentiment": 0}

This tough-talking drama from 20th Century Fox emulates the gritty Warner Bros. 'style' of its day, though it's hard not to be cynical about the script's high-falutin' insistence on the nobility of the press (!). Ethel Barrymore plays a matriarchal publisher with the kind of effortless dignity that distinguished her entire career, and most of the supporting cast are solid.

{"id": 44426, "text": "Once in a while, you watch a movie where you can just immediately tell that the directors mother is also his aunt. One such movie is Ghost Lake. As a no-/low-budget filmmaker, I generally sympathize with others in this end of the field. One has to cope with annoying editors and actors who, in various strange ways, convince you that they can actually act and sign on to the point where it's too late to replace them. But much of this can be forgiven if the general intention with the movie is good or just honest. Not so the case with Ghost Lake. It repeatedly rips off one horror movie after the other, all the while setting new lows in acting, shooting and musicianship (yup, the score was awful to boot).<br /><br />That being said, I did laugh my ass off watching it. Watching this movie was the equivalent of reading a list of cinematic don't's. And I don't mean \"don't\" as in \"Don't use voiceovers\" and similar snooty filmschool bs. I mean \"don't\" as in, \"Don't do this, because it looks like you can't tell your ass from your elbow, anyway you slice it\".

{"id": 37648, "text": "Billy Jack (Tom Laughlin) spends four years in prison for his killing of a sheriff's deputy. During that time, the Freedom School, a hippie commune led by Billy's lover Jean (Delores Taylor) begins to prosper, releasing newspapers and TV that stick it to the man, caring for underprivileged and abused children, and no doubt doing lots of drugs (oh, I'm sorry - drug use is against the rules there). Billy helps the Indians and the Freedom School stick up to the crooked landowner Posner (Riley Hill), who ultimately calls out the police and National Guard, with tragic (I guess) results.<br /><br />\"The Trial of Billy Jack\" is an atrocious film that has to be seen to be believed. On the other hand, that may be too high of a price. While it maintains some of the camp value of its predecessors, any enjoyment, unintentional or otherwise, is done in by the fact that the movie is THREE FRICKING HOURS LONG!!! The movie's pretentious, overwrought and hilariously un-ironic political and social content isn't the problem here; it's the length, and boy does it drag.<br /><br />The first Billy Jack had a certain purity of form. Clocking in at about two hours, it was a reasonably entertaining film which managed to be watchable, with the camp cheesiness and overwrought hippie world-view only enhancing the experience. The movie could never reconcile its pleas for pacifism with the appeal of Billy Jack's martial arts heroics, but it hardly mattered. The overlong guerrilla theater routines by Howard Hesseman and the interminable music numbers were the biggest flaws, but Laughlin managed to keep himself in check.<br /><br />No such luck here, as Trial of Billy Jack drips with a potent strain of narcissism. Laughlin's film is filled to the brim of self-indulgence, padding the film's running time with self-indulgence and smug posturing. At least a third of the movie is lengthy, droning performances of atrocious excuses for \"music\", by people with no talent (most egregiously, Laughlin's daughter Teresa). Billy Jack is continually celebrated throughout as a paragon of virtue, albeit a somewhat flawed one, sung about and worshiped by the freedom school kids - yeah, nice humility, Tom. And of course, Laughlin's smug self-assurance that we'll agree with our heroes and their noxious political viewpoint is rather off-putting as well, but he gets around that problem - sort of.<br /><br />The politics are by their nature laughable, accepting and endorsing every bit of radical, leftist conspiracy jargon as concrete fact. But the way Laughlin paints the issues is what makes it truly offensive. He juxtaposes the film's climactic massacre with real life school shootings like Kent State, portraying them as premeditated acts of mass murder by the National Guard. The villains are bigoted, greedy, harrumphing straw-men, not even convincing as caricatures. Laughlin and Co. seem convinced that they're so important that they're being investigated by the FBI, CIA, and the US government at large for their \"scorching exposes\" (Laughlin would, in real-life, use this excuse for the failure of his later Billy Jack Goes to Washington). The journalist interviewing Jean repeats leftist conspiracy propaganda as known fact. The final massacre is so over-the-top, it's simultaneously appalling and laughable; the idea that someone would actually hold this viewpoint, however, is what's truly appalling here (although, not as laughable as believing that thousands of rounds fired by trained Guardsmen could only result in three deaths in a huge crowd).<br /><br />This is offensive, not because of the politics, but because of the dishonesty; it's easy to paint everyone opposed to you as a brutal, vicious Fascist, and thus (in theory, anyway) renders any possible argument against the film moot. Like, you can't dislike this movie unless you're a paid shill, Man. It's a childish argument, and it says a lot about Laughlin that it's his primary defense against criticism. And we STILL have the problem that Billy Jack is kicking ass is pretty much antithetical to the peace and love message we're supposed to be getting.<br /><br />Okay, the movie has some camp value. The lengthy Indian vision scenes - where Billy Jack confronts his \"spirit double\" and a cave full of demons - are pretty darn funny, in a trippy sort of way. A lot of the dialogue and acting is pathetically bad (I love the scene where a hippie suggests that the Freedom School \"BOMB THE HELL OUT OF THEM!\"). But is so pompously self-important throughout - and so LONG - that it isn't even enjoyable. Two hours in, you'll be pining for the original film, with the \"epic\" karate fight in the lawn, Howard Hesseman's rambling improv comedy, and, yes, Coven's camp classic \"One Tin Soldier\" - and you'll realize that there's still an hour to go! But overall, this is a film that even the biggest bad movie buff should be leery of approaching.<br /><br />0/10", "sentiment": 0}

It has a light and hopeful tone to it. Having recently taken a class focusing in great detail on immediate post-war Japan, this film is a good reflection and comment on that time. Everyday hardships, such as black marketeering, inflation, and scarcity are well represented without being overwhelmingly depressing. The tone may often seem a bit maudlin, particularly the scene requesting audience participation near the end, yet this film was released in mid 1947 and life for the intended audience was as bad as or worse than our fictional couple. People could relate to the scenes portrayed. When the girl asks for the audience to clap, it is not just to raise her and her boyfriends spirits, it's to try to bring everyone up. Today, out of context, it seems corny, but back then in 1947, if you had just ducked into a dark movie theatre and spent your 5 or 10 or however many yen for a few hours escape on a Sunday afternoon with your girlfriend, it has a different meaning.

{"id": 9563, "text": "Jackie Cooper was the top child actor at MGM in the early 30s when it was the top studio. He started off as part of \"Our Gang\" but just a year later was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in \"Skippy\" (he just lost out to Lionel Barrymore in \"A Free Soul\"). L. B. Mayer called him \"a wonderful kid\" and teamed him and Wallace Beery in the emotional and heart wrenching film \"The Champ\". It has the most tear drenching finale of any film I have ever seen and Jackie Cooper gives an outstanding performance as Dink, the little boy who has an unswerving faith in his hopelessly alcoholic father. The sets have a very gritty and real look - not at all what you would expect from MGM \"the dream factory\".<br /><br />Little Dink lives with his dad, a washed up fighter who can't stay off the booze. His managers try to talk him up to some promoters, promising that he is the same fighter he always was - Dink's job is to sober him up but unfortunately it doesn't work. Andy \"The Champ\" has always promised Dink a race horse and when his luck changes, he buys \"Lil' Champ\" - an old and beat up horse that they train up for a race. The day of the race Dink meets his mother (he or she doesn't realise it), Linda, who has the horse \"Blue Boy\" next to \"Lil' Champ\" in the stables. Dink introduces her to his little mate - \"he's coloured\" he says, \"yes, but he's kind of a pretty colour\" she replies. (It was interesting that you didn't see her shake hands with the little boy, their hands were out of the camera range).<br /><br />When \"Lil' Champ\" loses the race, Linda (Irene Rich)realises who Dink is and wants to give him everything that he has missed out on. (Even though Linda seems lovely - her character is portrayed as once having been a gold-digger who only married Andy when he was rich and famous and left him for a more prosperous gentleman when he was down on his luck).<br /><br />Andy is then paid $100 to let Dink visit his mother - while there he sings a few bars of a popular song (Ruth Ettings' \"Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me\"), meets his step-sister Mary Lou (adorable Marcia Mae Jones) a little cutie who talks to Dink about the reality of fairy tales. After his visit Linda is determined to take Dink away from the unwholesome life he is leading with his dad. Dink and Andy have a magical relationship but after a heartfelt scene Andy convinces Dink to live with his mother, but with Dink away, he loses the will to go on.<br /><br />The ending is the most emotional ever and Jackie Cooper was a genuine star. There will not be a dry eye by the film's end. In an interview, I heard Jackie Cooper say he did not get on with Wallace Beery. They made a few pictures together and were considered a team, adored by the public. Cooper said whenever people stopped him in the street to ask what Beery was really like, he had to lie and say what a wonderful guy he was - he couldn't tell them the truth and spoil their illusion.

I had read user comments enthusiastically praising the film and was anxious to see it for myself. And, I'm so glad I did! Enzo G. Castellari's INGLORIOUS BASTARDS is a phenomenal war film, with superbly orchestrated action scenes and a really unique premise. It allows those who have committed wrong to make up for their mistakes in a very dangerous mission where the likelihood of survival is low.<br /><br />A small group of soldiers to be court-marshaled for bad behavior while serving in WWII escape a German attack while being transfered by their superiors to be tried for their crimes. Unable to re-join their American military due to their potential death by firing squad, they instead pursue the difficult task of moving through occupied France in the hopes of making it to neutral Switzerland, evading constant threats by stationed(..or moving)Nazi forces throughout the country-side. After picking up a German defector, the group encounter a number of hostile threats, using him as a possible method of escaping them, until the unfortunate slaughter of their own men, costumed in Nazi uniforms. In a twist of fate, they instead will assume the roles of the American soldiers they shot on accident by going on a frightening mission, in assistance with French freedom fighters(partisans)to commandeer a train containing a deadly war-head, Colonel in town to disarm it. When everything seems to be on schedule, the mission suffers a major set-back when a second train featuring a host of German soldiers arrives in the village where the first was supposed to stop, with many men dead after all is said and done.<br /><br />Great cast to accompany Enzo G. Castellari's series of exciting, thrilling shootouts. Bo Svenson as Lt. Robert Yeager, who acquires the leadership role of the team when he leads them out of a major jam where German and American soldiers are engaged in combat. Understanding German, having blond hair and blue eyes(..statuesque and fitting the profile of the typical Kraut), Yeager offers potential escape from sticky situations. Pvt. Fred Canfield(The Hammer, Fred Williamson)is the muscle of the group, his being black making things a bit tough when they are trying to go through a variety of German checkpoints. He often finds himself at odds with Tony(Peter Hooten), a gambler who has been up for Court Martial twice before his latest conviction of murder..Tony is a racist and makes the mistake of confronting Canfield one too many times, the result his being tossed for a loop! Nick(Michael Pergolani), an Italian thief whose pickpocketing(..and his abilities at forging documents!) actually benefits the group during their journey! Berle(Jackie Basehart), tried to desert, his sickening fear of war often causing his bowels to malfunction. Adolf(Raimund Harmstorf)is the German prisoner the team comes across, who willingly helps them along the way, before his fate is sealed with they encounter the American soldiers disguised as Nazi officers. Veronique(Michel Constantin)is the brave leader of the partisans and Nicole(Debra Berger)is a nurse whose family were murdered by a German air raid..she's Tony's love interest and bravely helps her people temporarily secure a village captured by Germans. Ian Bannen has the role of Colonel Buckner, the one responsible for disarming the warhead who establishes the plan to raid the train, including the plot to explode a bridge.<br /><br />Expert use of slow motion at the end and the numerous machine gun combats between our anti-heroes/partisans and their German adversaries really highlight this great adventure. The climax featuring the train and it's station is dynamic and plenty suspenseful. Fine sequence where Yeager, Tony, and Nick must rescue Canfield and Buckner from a castle containing a host of German officers. A real must-see for action fans clamoring for perilous situations featuring a band of soldiers with no home, attempting to salvage their lost reputations. Many of the war torn sequences where director Enzo G. Castellari displays the carnage left by a parade of warfare is stunning.

{"id": 3210, "text": "The original BBC version of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT shocked a nation way back in 1953 but this remake barely caused a ripple when broadcast three years ago and it's not too difficult to see why . Nowadays television audiences are much more sophisticated and television in the 21st century is more of a bastard child of cinema than theater , but it would be both churlish and incorrect to state that the failings and the lukewarm reception of this remake are down to the audience because the fault lies entirely with the production team <br /><br />A lot of people have complained about the anachronistic feel of the production . Indeed it doesn't really feel like it's set in the present day despite the scenes set at the Tate Modern and having BBC News 24 giving away exposition . Perhaps the most startling thing are the large number of characters who smoke , something both television production teams and government have cracked down on and I'm possibly correct in saying if this had been made in the Autumn of 2008 none of the actors would be allowed to smoke on screen by law <br /><br />Director Sam Miller usesa countless number of medium shots . In order to generate tension and atmosphere wouldn't close ups have been more effective ? Of course Miller is directing a live broadcast where anything or everything can go wrong so perhaps we should be more forgiving because of the amount of pressure he was under . Unfortunately any tension and atmosphere is diluted with the amount of clichéd POV shots and over head filming of London which outstay their welcome very quickly . There's also a lack of internal logic to these shots . If you're a mutating monster walking around London dressed in a cloak wouldn't someone call the police , and wouldn't the police be going out of their way to hunt down the mutating monster ? Are we to believe the monster hasn't been picked up on CCTV cameras ? Apparently the story is set in a world where we can send astronauts into deep space but no one has invented the close circuit TV camera . Do you understand the anachronistic criticisms now ? <br /><br />Some of the problems with the script actually lie at the door of Nigel Kneale . The original version of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was written as a suspenseful mystery . Alas however it was constructed very much as a whodunnit . Once you know what is happening to Victor Carroon etc there's little mystery involved . It's similar to watching a whodunnit unfold when you already know who did it so there's no surprises . Kneale did construct his story in an episodic form to be broadcast over a period of six weeks which leaves Richard Fell's adaptation very disjointed . In some places it's very slow and in other places so rushed you find yourself thinking if there's been a hitch in the production that stopped a scene being transmitted . We also have to endure a ridiculous scene where an art lover bleats \" If you destroy beauty then we don't deserve to go on living \" Oh please ! <br /><br />All in all this version of a Nigel Kneale classic is more of a nostalgic gimmick than anything else . If the BBC are thinking of doing a live version of QUATERMASS AND THE PIT then my advice is don't . It'd be terrible to see the greatest SF drama in the history of television turned in to something like this", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 37926, "text": "\"Dr. Black and Mr. Hyde\" is cursed by the same affliction as its protagonist/villain: it is a good movie that constantly morphs into a bad movie, until finally it's nothing more than a bad movie.<br /><br />The plot starts off well, and is very intriguing at first. Dr. Pryde (Bernie Casey) is working with female colleague Billie Worth (Rosalind Cash) on a way to regenerate damaged liver tissue. He donates medical care to a clinic in the Watts projects. There is some interesting tension in the movie's early scenes, as Dr. Pryde speaks frankly with one of his clinic patients, a prostitute named Linda (Marie O'Henry) that he's treating for hepatitis. Linda is an interesting character in the film, as the first time we see her, she's sitting nude on an examination table. A bold introduction for a character, especially a major one, and I don't remember many films where the director has made a move like this. Linda is very sympathetic, and Pryde seems to truly respect her, despite how some may look down on her profession.<br /><br />The attitude toward prostitution in the film is very matter-of-fact, which was fairly daring for a movie made in the early 70s, and it even proves to be a pivotal plot element. Dr. Pryde has an emotional discussion with Linda about how his mother passed away, which he blames on the inhabitants of a whorehouse who refused to help her. The main three actors here (Casey, Cash, and O'Henry) are all in very good form, which helps give the movie an unusual lift in quality.<br /><br />It's in the details that the film starts to go wrong. If Casey had been a bad actor, it would have been easier to understand how he descends into a dual personality after taking some of his own liver serum, which of course turns him into a rampaging beast. But considering that Pryde shows so much real interest and respect for Linda at the outset, it's impossible to understand why he would do what he does. After taking a single injection of the serum himself, he then decides to woo Linda on a date, lays a big line on her about not wanting her \"professional services\" and simply wanting her company, and then he reveals that it was all because he wants her to allow him to inject her with the serum. We lose our sympathy for Pryde, and immediately the film unravels.<br /><br />The Mr. Hyde creature is a strange one. One of the characters in the film refers to it as a \"haint\", which I don't get. My grandmother was southern, and I know full well that a \"haint\" is a ghost. Mr. Hyde is just Casey with some contact lenses, facial molds, and white makeup. It's funny how the people in the film are so easily duped by the transformation; in one scene, Hyde rampages inside a seedy bar, gets cut, and bolts outside into the parking lot, where he reverts to Pryde. His pursuers don't recognize him at all, despite the fact that he's wearing the same clothes, bleeding, and all that's changed is his complexion. Hyde doesn't even really look \"white\", as the movie suggests, and it's hilarious that the black folks in the movie pretend to be fooled by it. Perhaps if the makeup had been more shockingly white, it would have been an effective contrast.<br /><br />It bears mentioning that the film's director also made \"Blacula\", a film that is eons better than this one. \"Blacula\" was pure silliness too, but it was very entertaining and it never betrayed its characters the way this one does. \"Dr. Black and Mr. Hyde\" also has a bigger problem: it has no thrills or chills. There is only one mild shock, when an old lady patient suddenly lunges at a nurse. There's also a fairly effective chase scene where Hyde goes after Linda in an abandoned warehouse.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the remaining parts of the movie are fair to awful. The supporting cast is mostly terrible, especially the policemen who are working on the Hyde case, and it seems as if this part of the script is really badly done. The situations in the film make no sense, including one scene where Mr. Hyde uses his car to run down a pimp in an alley, and the pimp takes out his knife and attempts to \"stab\" the grille of the car in self defense. Whatever! Maybe if he'd hit a vital belt or gasket, he would have had a chance.<br /><br />In a very strange ending, Hyde climbs the Watts towers and is shot down, just like King Kong. The image is surprisingly haunting, a human body inside the twisting metal of the tower, but it's not enough to make up for the gross sins that have come before it. It's worth mentioning that \"Dr. Black and Mr. Hyde\" is not nearly as bad as one of the other blaxploitation horror riffs, \"Blackenstein\"--but those of you who have actually SEEN \"Blackenstein\" will understand that this is not saying very much.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 20920, "text": "After The Wild Bunch had pushed back a few boundaries in terms of violence, especially within the western genre, there followed a spate of similar westerns. Billy Two Hats, Chato's Land, The Hunting Party, The Revengers and The Last Hard Men were among the front-runners. Also on any list of brutal '70s revenge-westerns would be The Deadly Trackers, originally planned as a Samuel Fuller movie but completed by Barry Shear after Fuller quit the project. This violent, bloodthirsty film is, alas, somewhat disappointing.<br /><br />Irish sheriff Sean Kilpatrick (Richard Harris) looks after the Texas town of Santa Rosa and has made a point of solving crimes and capturing criminals without resorting to violence. In fact, he has never in his life fired a gun in anger, yet has somehow fostered total law, order and respect among the townsfolk. His methods are tested to the limit when outlaw Frank Brand (Rod Taylor in a surprisingly sadistic performance) and his gang rob the local bank. During their escape attempt, the outlaws inadvertently kill Kilpatrick's own wife and child. Devastated, Kilpatrick ditches his anti-gun, anti-violence attitude and pursues Brand and his cronies. The chase leads to Mexico, where Kilpatrick has no official authority and is viewed as little more than an outlaw himself. The Irish sheriff tracks down and kills Brand's gang one-by-one, until just he and Brand remain.<br /><br />Just a year earlier, Barry Shear had made the film Across 110th Street, regarded as the most violent movie ever made up to that point, so it's perhaps no surprise that this film emphasises the gore and brutality to the extent it does. Harris is quite memorable as the Irish sheriff, giving another of his energetic performances, and Taylor's villainous turn reveals an ugly side rarely portrayed by the actor in his other films. However, in most aspects The Deadly Trackers fails to make the grade as a good, worthwhile film. It is far too simplistic for its own good, with no resonance beyond the immediate plot (and the plot itself is pretty basic, being nothing more than a straightforward chase narrative). The supporting performances are generally rather lacklustre, possibly because none of the characters beyond the two principal players carry much depth or interest. Also, the story is dismayingly familiar, with precious little that it fresh or original; just lots of tired and predictable scenes that have been begged, borrowed and stolen from many other sources (even the music is lifted directly from The Wild Bunch.... perhaps to keep the budget down?) On the whole, The Deadly Trackers is a dismal misfire in which the detail to violence and the intriguing lead performances are the sole points of interest.", "sentiment": 0}

That's a lot of film time with nothing amusing happening. Buster seems to have become uninspired once the pathos of the mistaken identity narrative take over.

Far from being a sympathetic schlep who we can sympathize with for falling short of his dreams, Owen comes off as a petty, whiny, vindictive loser who does more to sabotage his own efforts than the supposedly cynical, money-is-everything city that surrounds him.<br /><br />Given an opportunity to enter the world of legitimate literature by writing the biography of a scientist, Owen for some reason feels the need to leave the city in the rudest way possible. Ostensibly, this is so he will never be tempted to come back but it comes off as a contrived way to allow our hero to scandalize, verbally brutalize, and otherwise act in a horribly anti-social way to everyone that he has been associating with over the past few years. But then, just as he has burned every single bridge imaginable, he meets and falls madly in love with the girl of his dreams.

{"id": 4700, "text": "I adore this movie. Putting it into words as to why is probably far more difficult for this film than any of the others i have talked about on this website. Firstly i can totally empathise with the lead character.... even down to the the fantastic choice of bands displayed on his wall (the Jam and the Specials although i am not too sure about Patti Smith myself!) We've all probably been in the situations Gregory finds himself in during the movie and this just brings it all back... playing football in the school team (and chatting nonchalently to spectators when should have been keeping an eye on players bearing down on goal), getting into scrapes with teachers and of course that first date with the girl of your dreams. I always come away from watching this movie with a high feel good factor. Gregory ends up with Susan who is far more suited and better for him than Dorothy even if it takes the whole movie for him to discover this. You even feel it will work out for his mates Andy and Charlie as they trudge off at the end in the cheerful knowledge that they can start afresh chasing girls the next day (i love the way Charlie doesn't say a word thru the whole movie, goes along with Andy's silly schemes and eventually gets the last word). In addition to these characters there's a whole slew of fantastic characters such as Steve whos obsessed with his baking enterprise, the eccentric headmaster (\"off you go, you small boys,\") and of course Mr Menzies the bumbling PE teacher who isn't really taken seriously by the other male teachers in the school and is obsessed with putting together the perfect football team. Another thing i like is the way the younger kids seem more in control and knowledgeable than Gregory and his mates. Gregory's sister is the one with the fashion sense and is the guiding hand in trying to sort out his love life while its Gregory who is the petulant immature one when confronted by his sisters' young admirer at the front door.

The whole feel of the film is a culmination of a typical Conan rip-off and the Hercules TV series that Kevin Sorbo starred in, and as much as he tries old Kev will always be Hercules. Though I have to say, there are a few features to this film that rescue it to just above watchable. Number one being the soundtrack, not only is there the typical orchestral score behind every dramatic scene and/or plot revelation but we are actually treated to some rock music during the occasional fight scenes. Now, being a man who believes that the soundtrack is integral to any great movie (Come on, you all remember the theme/soundtrack to all your favourite films) I felt uplifted to hear some heavy guitar music over the fights. What a great idea, it works well and I wish we'd hear more of it in bigger Hollywood productions. But on to the rest of the film. Performances - average to just above average. A little disappointed with Tia Carrere but to be honest I doubt there was much more she could have done in the role. Maybe someone else would have been better for the job. Everyone else was OK except for Thomas Ian Griffith who absolutely blew me away. To start I was kind of annoyed with his character but as he got more and more evil I found his time on screen to be entertaining. His lines and performance were delivered perfectly, best performance in the film. There were some OK-to-low scale special effects in this but nothing that can't be forgiven on something of this calibre. Most of the fight scenes I found to be very entertaining making you follow each swing of the blade/axe, and they were carried through the film by the rock music I mentioned earlier. Better fights that I expected. Lastly but not least, even for a fantasy film the costumes were just bizarre and I think I should leave it there.

It is an extremely moving film, though it may be one of the most difficult movies I ever sat through, both the beauty and brutality are overwhelmingly relentless.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the film demonstrates a rare instance where Life is fuller, richer and more interesting than Fiction. The dramas that Hollywood feeds us pale in comparison to the colour of humanity and the depths of emotional courage portrayed in this film. <br /><br />It is a film to be experienced, and ranks right up there with classics like Nanook of the North, Das Boot, etc., please don't ever miss it.", "sentiment": 0}

The writer/director said in the featurette that he was making it as white trashy as he possibly could. I understand the making of another world to create this film but it had such a bad ring to it.<br /><br />The movie starts out strong but the pacing for the rest of the film wasn't great. The blatant stupidity of the police with blood evidence and dismissing getting a DNA test was frustrating and wholly unrealistic. The gore was good for the most part, even if a little over done. Some of the lead performances where great but the supporting roles really fell apart. The costume wasn't fantastic but was used effectively.<br /><br />Over all it wasn't great, I feel like I wasted some time and money. If you're really into werewolf films, I'd recommend it.

{"id": 1960, "text": "What a terrific little film this is. Made in 1973 on what was presumably a very low budget, this two-hander about a pair of research scientists experimenting on apes in a remote mountain science station is a lean and mean horror-thriller, put together with maximum conviction, a haunting atmosphere and stratospherically good performances.<br /><br />Robert Culp and Eli Wallach brilliantly portray the disintegrating relationship between the two men, as each comes to suspect the other with tampering with the heating systems, despoiling the food, and generally fouling things up.<br /><br />Having discovered the previous lone occupant of the research outpost frozen to death, it seems something very sinister is haunting the men. What could it possibly be? I won't spoil things by revealing the solution to the mystery - it works extremely well, and the moment when the nearly frozen Culp manages to get back into the station and confronts Wallach, axe in hand, is one of the classic scenes of horror, t.v. or otherwise.<br /><br />It's a film which draws you in gradually, relying on small moments to unsettle and rivet the viewer. This in its own way is as good as Spielberg's Duel. A treat for a first time viewer.<br /><br />Please, please, please somebody somewhere get this released on DVD.

{"id": 30430, "text": "The 1982 comedy MY FAVORITE COMEDY was a lovingly made period piece that takes place during a wonderful time in entertainment history...the infancy of live television in the 1950's (or more specifically, YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS). This laugh-filled comic romp follows the adventures of Benji (Mark Linn-Baker), a gopher for COMEDY CALVACADE (this film's version of YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS), who is excited when a swashbuckling actor of the period named Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) has been booked as a guest on the show turns out to be a skirt-chasing alcoholic who Benji is put in charge of keeping under control until showtime. This movie is a lovely valentine to the 1950's with exquisite period detail and an intelligent screenplay that invokes the period so beautifully. O'Toole gives the performance of a lifetime as Swann, an alternately laugh out loud funny and heartbreakingly warm performance that earned him an Oscar nomination, yet somehow Linn-Baker somehow manages to hold his own and never allows O'Toole to blow him off the screen. O' Toole and Linn-Baker get solid support from Lainie Kazan as Benji's mother, Joseph Bologna as King Kaiser, the star of Comedy Calvacade, Cameron Mitchell as a not-too bright gangster, and Adolph Green as the manic producer of the show. A good looking, smartly-written superbly written comedy that documents a long gone era in entertainment history and tells a warm and amusing story as well.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 6433, "text": "(There are Spoilers) One of the most hidden fact about how war effects those who participate in it on both sides of the battle-line is the basis of the film \"In the Valley of Elah\": Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br /><br />Based of the true story, shown on CBS' 48 Hours, of the late US Army Specialist Richard Davis \"In the Valley of Elah\" shows how those servicemen and women who are now engaged in the fighting in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, suffer more then just from being shot bombed and ambushed by the enemy El-Qeada and Iraqi insurgents. They suffer from their own demons that they were exposed to and took back home with them. Demons that in many ways lead to actions as destructive as those they faced on the Iraqi battlefield.<br /><br />Former US Army criminal investigator Sgt. Hank Deerfield, Tommy Lee Jones, is called by the MP's at the military base that his son Michael, Jonathan Tucker,is stationed at and told that if his son doesn't show up within 48 hours that he'll be declared AWOl. Hank knowing that something is wrong in that Michael being the gong-ho army man that he is would never leave his unit, here in the safe and free good old USA, this after searing 18 months in the Iraqi war-zone. Arriving at the army base Hank realizes that something isn't right with the way he's treated by Michael's fellow GI's in what exactly happened to him at the time of his disappearance.<br /><br />Checking out Michael's room, in the army barracks, Hank spots a cell-phone and , knowing that it's off-limits due to an army investigation, slips it into his pocket and takes it back to his hotel-room. Getting a friend of his electronic expert Rick Gonzalez to get the video, on the cell-phone video camera, cleaned up Hank sees the war in Iraq and Michael's, and his fellow GI's, participation in it. And what Hank sees greatly disturbs him.<br /><br />It's not long after that a badly burned decomposed and dismembered body is found just outside of the Army base. The murder victim turns out to be no other then Hank's long lost son Michael Deerfield! With both the Army M.P's and local police not quite sure under who's jurisdiction the crime scene falls under, the body was found in pieces in both that of the US military and local police zones, the vital evidence in the crime ends up being corrupted due to both sides mishandling it. It's when Hank and local Bradford police Det. Emily Sanders , Charlize Theron, re-examine the murder scene it turns out that whoever killed Michael didn't do that good of a job at it. The badly blotched murder thus eliminates a local Mexican drug gang, who would have done a much better job in covering up the crime, that was the #1 suspect in Michael's murder at the time.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***Putting all the pieces together Hank as well as Det. Sanders come up with the shocking conclusion that Michael's murder was the result of something that he did earlier that evening. As all the evidence mounts in not just who murdered Michael but what the circumstances were to his grizzly death it becomes apparent that he himself was more responsible for his untimely death then those who inflicted it on him!<br /><br />War brings the best and worse out of those who fight and suffer in it and in this case it brought out the absolute worst of Michael Deerfield. Michael Deerfield was left a mental cripple when he came back from Iraq, like so many of his comrades in arms, but was not given the treatment, by the US military, that he so desperately needed. Unhinged and with what seemed like a death wish Michaels out of control actions were guaranteed to lead him ether into a mental institution or an early grave. Hank despite denying to himself the obvious, from the cell-phone video he observed, was left broken and destroyed together with his wife and Michael's mom Joan, Susan Sarandon, when the truth finally came out.<br /><br />P.S Before he was murdered Michael sent his parents a package from Iraq that had deep significance to him and those he served with there. A weathered torn and bullet ridden old American flag. Hank in tears had that memory of the war, that in effect killed his son Michael, flown at the high-school that Michael attended. Fasened to the flag poll with rolls of utility tape, so it well never be taken down, Hank had the flag flying in the universal sigh of distress: Upside Down!

Alas, although the knight's role is little more than a cameo in Alice, the writers here have mercilessly expanded the part, even though it meant treading on the lines of more capable players like break-your-heart Rita La Roy (a most engaging and super-attractively regal young duchess) and Kay Hughes' pleasing Cheshire Cat who, as we might expect, disappears from the action, alas, for long spells. We are left too often with Wade Boteler's far too bellicose Mad Hatter, and are also forced to suffer far too much tiresome comic relief from Tweedledum's Franklin Pangborn, although admittedly William Newell's occasional input as Tweedledee is just about right.<br /><br />Worse still, Ralph Staub (who squeezed maybe a dozen feature assignments in between his excruciating \"Screen Snapshots\" series) has handled TMM in a mercilessly heavy-handed and thoroughly routine style that totally smothers every latent spark of wit in a screenplay that was none too promising to begin with.<br /><br />Miserable production values don't help either.

Hmmm... Try to imagine that !.<br /><br />The boy here discovered that the cinematic dream, even if it was as incredibly fantastic as (Marilyn) herself, is just a dream. So all the rest of our silly, foolish, and risky actual life is more fantastic because we actually lived it. Even if it contained some nightmares already ! Hence the jam in the phone booth with a girl you want becomes eventually more important than a lively fantasy you may live like the movie fulfills indeed - with your own calendar girl.<br /><br />This movie made too many regards which are truly full of love and longing to a lot of things : the adolescence's folly, the friendship's coolest memories, the pure fondness of a movie star, the fiery sexy yet innocent days of the late 1950s and the early 1960s, the good old Hollywood, and lastly the utmost sex icon ..The shiniest star yet.. (Marilyn Monroe). She was portrayed here as sad lonely woman, missing what these young men already have : the friendship, who dies with the beauty of that era and the end of those guys' minority too; as if this time was the adolescence's climax of America itself before Vietnam, the series of assassinations, the hippie revelation.. etc.<br /><br />I loved the whole deal : the nice comedy, the good characterization, the performance from all the young bunch, the bright cinematography, and the atmosphere which was in low budget but so solid, look at the details to know how it's a sincere adorer movie for what it speaks about (the clever wicked opening credits, the bits of Marilyn's movies or photos, the soundtrack's songs.. etc). It got a \"real\" sentimental script and directing.<br /><br />Although the face of (Stéphanie Anderson) as (Marilyn) didn't appear on screen like a high too glaring to watch phantasm, but truly she delivered by her voice and body a fine performance. Still the part of the kiss is such a magical cinematic moment and one of the most immortal kisses I've ever seen as well, not only because its achievement of what any fan of (Marilyn) dreamed of (getting a special kiss from her) but also because it was one unforgettable hot kiss in so colorfully sensual close up. In brief it was as madly sexy as any of Marilyn's kisses yet more emotional and a bit lamentably moving. <br /><br />It's one comic so passionate movie which has no shame in presenting this obligatory phase of life when you've got to know your dream so consequently your fact !, and what a lessen the movie gives softly through its gentle manifesto : viva the 1950s, (Marilyn), the boyhood, the fictional world, and the most of all : viva the genius experiment of factual LIFE.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 37120, "text": "The IMDb votes for BURGLAR are all over the place. Substantial segments of users graded it 6/10, 5/10, 4/10 and 3/10. A notable percentage also voted 7/10 and 1/10. Such divisions only reinforce what is obvious to anyone who's seen this Whoopi Goldberg vehicle -- it's an extremely uneven effort.<br /><br />One of BURGLAR's biggest strengths is that it hits the ground running. Whoopi is great in the opening scenes, disguised as a fat-bottomed ol' lady ripping off a small piece of a rich man's riches. This sets the stage nicely for what promises to be a fast-paced blend of comedy, action, and snappy dialog. The film continues at a surprisingly entertaining level as our thieving hero, owing 25 G's to keep the lid on past misdeeds, agrees to snatch back some jewelry for a bitter ex-wife. Only things go terribly wrong when her target is murdered before she can make a clean getaway. Now she's the chief suspect and, just as O.J. once famously pledged, must find the real killer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's at this point, when our expectations are highest, that BURGLAR begins to fall apart. The film grows progressively (and unnecessarily) lewd and at times downright dreary (particularly the out-of-place climax). Though there are a couple of laughs, much of the humor is so painfully unfunny you almost cringe. Performance wise, Whoopi is at the top of her game. But hard ass/cutie pie act -- punching men in the groin one minute and making wisecracks the next --never really works. Spastic comic Bobcat Goldthwait is as zany as ever as her best pal, but no one seemed to realize that his is an act meant to be taken in much smaller doses than this.<br /><br />BURGLAR would have worked much better as a straight action thriller. Its insistence on trying to be humorous is what hurts it the most. Of course under no circumstances would this be a classic. But at the end of it all, you get the sense BURGLAR could have been more than it was.", "sentiment": 0}

In an equal-and-opposite kind of way, Ged's pride and power unleashed his own potential destruction.

Even after when I came to know that Ashutosh Gowarikar is directing this movie, one who gave us amazing experience in \"Lagaan\" and \"Swades\", I was still skeptical to watch it.<br /><br />But as a movie critic when I got an invitation to watch first day first show with a guest, my mother convinced me to go and take her too. The movie was just what I expected, twisted history, glorifying the Mughals who looted, raped, destroyed Mandir (temples), mass converted, and openly carried out pogroms. The movie was long, boring, and repetitive. For the whole 3.5 hrs I could not figure out where is the story heading and what is the director trying to convey. I can't believe it is from Mr. Gowarikar who gave us \"Lagaan\" and brewed the love story between Bhuvan-Gauri-Elizabeth so beautifully even when the plot was about getting rid of the lagaan (tax).<br /><br />But in Jodhaa Akbar I was cringing in my seat thinking when the movie will end and what the end would be as the story was not developing any climax. It was so twisted, sometimes Sujamal is with Akbar, sometimes he is not, sometimes Maham Anga is nice, sometimes she is not, hey Ram (oh God), so confusing. The love story (if there was any) between Jodhaa and Akbar was like making a mountain out of mole. The war scenes were average. There were few good comic one liners from the eunuch.

The film has no context whatsoever, and there is no continuity from start to finish. There are no consequences for any of the actions.<br /><br />The family is devoid of morals or values, and yet they lead an idyllic existence. There is little or no emotion between them, yet we are asked to believe that they are as close and loving a family as ever lived. The two children evolve into teenagers that assume the usual bad habits and make the usual bad choices, but there is never any crisis ensuing, and all is forgiven because nothing is really wrong.<br /><br />Every character that impacts on their lives seems construed to be as unlikely as people can be, and yet there are so many of them in this one story. And then they just disappear from the scenery as implausibly as they entered.<br /><br />The persistent introduction of totally unnecessary episodes of menstruation, gratuitous sex, birth control, intoxication, etc., etc., is simply irritating. Kris Kristofferson shows once again that Dolf Lundgren is not the worst actor in film history.<br /><br />As for a theme or moral, good luck finding it.

Columbo lingers in the harbor, in no hurry at all, works together with Mac (because his boss insists), makes him drive his car, gets entangled with Robert Vaughn in the car, with the telephone, tries TM on the deck of the boat. He seems in a jolly mood all the time. Note how he touches and lays his arms around everyone in this episode. It is an episode as calming as the waterfront itself. And it probably isn't up to what most viewers expect. But that always is a problem. We need to accept it as a creative thing too. And Columbo always had it's own patterns and in-jokes, but because of many different directors as well as guest stars and considering the fact that the show ran for 35 years, there is no such thing as the one formula it sticks to. So it is really quite sad that there are always these remarks 'the last of the real Columbo's', 'the final good episode', 'here's where episodes became to long', 'here's where Falk was too old', etc, etc. Enjoy every episode for its own merits. \"Last Salute\" is in no way possible to be compared with outings like \"Double Exposure\" of \"A Stitch in Crime\".

Just a minor example is J. Edgar Hoover, the King of Blackmail, stating that he would never want to see anyone publicly embarrassed as a result of his investigations.<br /><br />At one point, it is railing against dictators and the one-party system, and in the same breath has the nerve to show film footage of Senator Joseph McCarthy! <br /><br />The thing I personally found most offensive was its presentation that all the anti-war protests at the White House were engineered and funded by the International Communist Party, and that as soon as Stalin and Hitler had a falling out, the demonstrations instantly evaporated.<br /><br />The film kept my interest.

But there's no doubt about it; this film is cool. It's also very much a 'guy' film... get 'the gang' together, call up all your guy friends and get a copy of this film, preferably an uncut one. You'll love it. So did I, no doubt about that. The better part of the film is basically a remake of the first... new characters and new plot points, but the progression and such is the same. The situations are the same, but the ways in which we get to them are different from the first film. It's a fine idea, and it works great, too, because the outcomes of the situations are different, as well... meaning, you see a scene and go \"Oh, right, I remember this from the first... oh yeah, now he... what the ...!?\" The plot is interesting, new and old parts alike. It's not Shakespeare, but it keeps your interest. The acting is the same fairly low standard as that of the first. The characters are equally ill-developed(though this time, I *could* tell them apart... they were easier to tell from each other, however, so maybe I wasn't the only one who couldn't tell those in the first apart?). The editing is excellent, just as the case was with the first. The special effects have improved... harder to figure out than those of the first, and that says quite a lot. The budget is higher(ten-fold, according to this very site), and it's most definitely noticeable. The emphasis throughout all of the film is mostly on humor and 'coolness' factor, very little on scares and horror. There's about the same amount of gore, at least as far as I could tell. The film is worth watching for just about any guy... regardless of maturity, really. There are things here that will make every guy watching it go \"way cool!\". One scene in particular had said effect on me... around the one hour mark, involving a chainsaw and a shotgun... anyone who has seen the film already know what I'm talking about, and I won't say anymore so as to not spoil it for anyone who hasn't. See it for yourself; you won't regret it. I recommend this film to any fan of Sam Raimi, gore, the first The Evil Dead, slapstick and/or Bruce Campbell. Of course, all guys should check it out. The film has such a thick 'guy' vibe, it should almost be mandatory for guys to watch it. Anyway, if you fit into one or more of the aforementioned groups, get a hold of this flick and watch it.

It's called 'Cult Classics', and the title that immediately called out to me was \"Terror Of Tiny Town\". Wouldn't you know it, the darn thing turned out to be a midget Western. No, not a short feature, but a movie with an all midget cast! It came out the same year as another novelty Western featuring an all Black cast called \"Two Gun Man From Harlem\".<br /><br />The principle is pretty much the same here. Take your standard 'B' oater, pit your white hat hero against a dastardly villain, and populate it with nothing but midget actors. What's sort of cool in the story is the early misdirection which seems to implicate Tex Preston (Billy Platt) as a cattle rustler before it's revealed there's a third party villain working the Preston's against the Lawson's. Bat Haines (Little Billy Rhodes) is as nasty a villain as you'll find in any John Wayne, Roy Rogers or Durango Kid picture, even to the tune of keeping the local sheriff in his pocket.<br /><br />The hero of the piece, Buck Lawson is played by Billy Curtis in his very first film role. Obviously he caught someone's eye to recommend casting him as the mayor of Munchkin Land in 1939's \"Wizard of Oz\", from there going on to a rather prodigious movie career. Western fans will note the resemblance between the young Curtis in 'Tiny Town' and the sixty four year old actor who was made mayor of Lago by The Stranger in \"High Plains Drifter\". To his credit, Curtis did his best to stay away from roles that denigrated little people, and did a creditable job here.<br /><br />Still, it's hard watching the picture not to crack up every now and then over inadvertently funny scenes like the midget cowboys riding on their Shetland ponies, or walking into a saloon under the swinging door. The movie opted to drift back and forth between a normal adult size world and a miniature one to achieve different effects; the scene I thought was exceptional was the one that played out with the runaway stagecoach built to little people scale. Some of the goofier scenes involved pint size singers whose voices were obviously dubbed.<br /><br />\"The Terror of Tiny Town\" won't make anyone's best films list, but you know, it really shouldn't be on anyone's worst list either. Take it with a grain of salt and you'll probably be entertained. A couple questions need answering though. Why was that penguin in the middle of the movie? And if a regular cowboy fires a six-shooter, does a midget use a three-shooter?", "sentiment": 0}

The infected water(it's molecular structure altered by the introduced alien substance from the glowing meteor) causes people and livestock to act irrationally, soon turning violent. Hysteria, dementia, violent mood swings, and skin mutations all result from the infected water.The fruit is worthless internally despite looking ripe and healthy externally. The local realtor and city councilman, Charlie Davidson(Steve Carlisle) woos a TVA water employee, Willis(John Schneider)hoping to get a contract for building a dam in their community.<br /><br />Poor Zack(Wil Wheaton) has to rough it on his own once his mother, Francis(Kathleen Jordon Gregory) becomes \"under the weather\" and his sister(Amy, Wil's sis) is assaulted by manic chickens, as Nathan(Akins) and his antagonistic jerk son, Cyrus(Malcolm Danare), both even worse after being infected, torment him through insults and harsh treatment..you see he's not their blood(..his mother married Nathan, it seems, because they needed support he could give) which means they feel little pity or affection towards him. Nathan is a hard, strict, bible-quoting fanatic who doesn't want anyone \"butting in\" to matters he considers private, even if disease and death spread because of the infected water, or what's evident before him, the fact that his family are afflicted with a plague.<br /><br />Tolerating Claude Akins for the duration of this film proves to be difficult because he's such a loud and repugnant creature you just want to see suffer in the worst possible way for the problems he causes. And, Wheaton is certainly easy to sympathize with because he's caught between a rock and hard place, little wiggle room to remove himself as madness evolves all around him. Of course, those involved in attempting to cover up something which could prove harmful regarding future prosperity will get their just desserts. Some really spine-tingling make-up effects showing what the mutations and disease cause to humans(and particularly the fruit and cattle)such as opening wounds bursting forth maggots, slimy puss, and beetles! The climax, as the house literally begins imploding while sinking into the earth, is a bit too much. The hideous nature for which causes mother Francis to deform into a ghastly monstrosity is really potent stuff. I'm sure Akins and Danare's fate will be met with applause. I do consider The Curse a success in regards to how it can effectively make your skin crawl, but other than that, I find this rather foul in all respects. It seems to suffer post-production problems, in script particularly, as characters vanish, while others make such preposterous choices which could cause irreversible results(..not to mention a ridiculous ending which leads us to believe that nothing was done in regards to the crisis of the film, written off as no threat or danger to the communities surrounding the farm whose soil and water could cause a national outbreak).<br /><br />This is part of a series of films unrelated to each other.", "sentiment": 0}

It wastes the huge talent of Gene Kelly, and does little more for the gifted Deanna Durbin. Deanna cries and sobs and looks hurt a lot, while otherwise amiable Kelly is forced to appear to be mean and insensitive. Two flashbacks tell the story, the second being set earlier in time than the first. The music throughout is a mess, becoming so loud at the corny and predictable ending that you want to shout at the screen. Several scenes in the film are just filler, including a symphonic orchestra scene that must have cost Universal a bundle. Gale Sondergaard was good, but then she was playing her usual villainous role.<br /><br />In short, here is one to miss.

{"id": 2684, "text": "We as people in love tend to go after the unavailable, that which tempts us but manages to remain maddeningly out of reach, or just within the spectrum of possibility but vanishing at the last crucial moment. Love is strange, yet we pursue it like the blind leading the blind, moving around in circles, no beginning, no end, and with an increasing sense of futility.<br /><br />Mathieu is one of those men. He's been sent over the edge by the promise of love and has publicly humiliated a young woman at a train station with a bucket of water as she attempts to board the train he's on. Passengers sharing his booth react in horror, but he has his own story to tell. The more he delves into it the less it seems to be about love and the more it looks like an obsession-fixation with the impossible: a woman, the very same one he's splashed with the bucket of water, named Conchita, arresting and bewitching, but one who would make a tease seem innocent by comparison.<br /><br />Conchita is a horror -- a woman ugly on the inside as she is alluring on the outside. She brings only misery to Mathieu, but he can't seem to get rid of her, and she inexplicably returns to him over and over again to repeat a cycle of love-hate that slowly eats away at him. One moment she's kittenish, the next, cold. Every time they're about to reach the moment of sexual communion something happens, or she announces she's a virgin as she wears an impenetrable chastity corset to which she has the key. She's not above gifts... or using her male companions to also rob Mathieu of specific amounts of money. And on top of that, a soothsayer has the nerve to tell him that he is the one who treats a young woman badly and as an offrend for her services, has him give some coins to a young mother who is carrying a tiny pig in her arms like it were a baby.<br /><br />Still, the question remains, what does she want with Mathieu? She could be a latter-day Mildred Rogers, leeching away at the man she despises while manipulating him into a frenzy. She obviously knows her own sexual power: at one moment she lays on top of Mathieu, naked, teasing him with words and promises as he can only caress her and wish that one day she will relent and literally, let him in.<br /><br />Peppered throughout the story are allusions to terrorist attacks on the city where Mathieu lives. While it may just seem a little extra seasoning added to color the story, with Bunuel there is no casualty, and inexorably, like in THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, violence comes and literally invades the domestic war that both Conchita and Mathieu are engaged in.<br /><br />Bunuel's last film is one of the least Surrealistic in nature as well as one of the most. It's a contradiction, like Conchita herself is a contradiction of personalities contained within one woman. Somehow people who saw this movie were under the assumption, before entering the story, that this would be a more Hitchcockian story like VERTIGO, but in having both Carole Bouquet and Angela Molina swap entrances and exits, he manages to convey the most cerebral of his incursions into Surrealism. A woman who is really two who is the embodiment of repulsion and desire even when she herself is a prisoner of her own need for teasing -- what better way to have two woman play one? While the cool, reserved, and near frigid Bouquet balances one side of the woman, the more emotional and girlish Molina pirouettes on the other, and in the middle, poor Mathieu (for once, a very sympathetic Fernando Rey), caught in his own struggle, telling his story, unable to go even when he (justifiably) beats her at the height of his rage. A more conventional ending would have had the two parting ways after their physical exchange, but Bunuel had other plans, and his last sequence is one that only he could envision for a story about the polarities of love and hate, desire and repulsion.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 34687, "text": "A mother and her young son emerge from their house for the last time as a family made temporary by an interrupting war. The thin trunks of topless trees can't camouflage the old man in black whose convergence with the woman and the boy is halted by the next anxious moment. The bible should be a dead giveaway to this apprehensive encounter, but the priest removes his hat before he gets any closer, just so there's no confusion about the meaning of their meeting. Before long, Eero(Topi Majaniemi) and his mother(Marjaana Maijala) are told by some grim women that they'll have to separate. And so it is, the church's will, that Eero finds himself on a crowded boat with other fatherless Finnish children, en route to Sweden where he'll live with a Swedish family until the war is over.<br /><br />\"Aideista parhain\" is about the unexamined feelings between Eero and his mother Kirsti during the period of their severed existences, in which both parties are forced to revisit when the former \"war child\" returns to Sweden for the funeral of his foster mother, breaking the complicit silence they maintained throughout the intervening decades. Told in flashback, this black and white film switches to color, as if the past is more vivid to Eero than the present.<br /><br />By boat, by train, and then by bus, the boy whose father was killed by Russians, meets his new guardians on an unpaved road; Hjalma(Michael Nyqvist) and Signe(Maria Lundqvist) Jonsson, one of many Swedish couples who provided shelter and sustenance to over seventy-thousand Finnish children affected by the war. While the farmer seems accommodating enough, Signe is hostile and sometimes downright odious towards Eero from the outset, walking ahead of her husband and charge with a head full of steam, back to their house on a farm. Since we recognize that \"Aideista parhain\" aspires to be an epic cut from the same cloth as American epics about life during wartime, we're not fooled by Signe's distaste for the \"strange\" Finnish boy with his strange Finnish ways. Panorama after panorama of sumptuous Swedish scenery makes it clear that \"Aideista parhain\" is governed by the same parameters as a mainstream studio movie from Hollywood. Signe may shout, or even hit Eero, but she's not going to stab him with a kitchen knife, nor will the boy, like a boy from some Patrick McCabe adaptation. The movie's soundtrack is so sentimental, so heavily laden with strings to overemphasize every moment of incident with its crescending bulge, it takes away the possibility of the unexpected, because \"Aideista parhain\" is essentially a European version of a prestige film meant to secure multiple Oscar nominations.<br /><br />But when Signe's moment of transformation arrives, the emergence of the nurturing mother beneath that gruff exterior we predicted all along seems entirely arbitrary, as is her epiphany about Eero's sudden lovability. In the last scene, Signe chastises the boy for stealing money and running away. She calls social services to send the boy back home. But when the administrative woman suggests that Eero would be sent to a children's home, Signe has a change of heart, but the audience will be hard-pressed to allocate that change of heart's origin. Thin air, that's where she got it. His impending departure should be cause for celebration after her constant ill-mannered behavior towards the boy. There's not enough smoke and mirror-magic from the screenplay to obscure the paradigm.<br /><br />After \"Aideista parhain\" is through with casting Signe as the villain, we learn that Eero's mother abandoned him in favor of a German soldier. The film would be riveting if we, along with Eero, had a harder time deciding between both mothers when it's time for his return to Finland. \"Aideista parhain\" decides for us. Of course, we're more sympathetic towards Signe's claim, after all, his birth mother is f****** a soldier affiliated with the Nazi party. While Eero functions as a replacement for Signe's dead little girl(who drowned under her care), the mother uses her son as a preventive measure against a heartbreak of the romantic sort(or so it seems).<br /><br />\"Aideista Parhain\" gets even more manipulative after the old man learns belatedly about his mother's intentions in a letter written by Signe. It's a far-fetched notion that Eero never broached the subject with Kirsti in all those years, because if he felt like a consolation prize to a German, logic dictates that he'd return to Sweden and seek the real love of a devoted mother. \"Aideista Parhain\" is unmistakably misogynistic; it gets off on reducing an old woman to tears, then tries to have it both ways by redeeming her. But it's too late. The audience will feel jerked around after investing our allegiance with Signe.<br /><br />\"Aideista parhain\" casts Signe and Kirsti as the mother and the whore, then lacks the conviction to let the sow be a sow.", "sentiment": 0}

The strippers at the club, I understand, are, or at least some of them were, actual performers at the actual club, Crazy Horse West, where the movie was largely shot. A little puzzling now and again the film nevertheless moves well against its sleazy background and constant sense of mob menace. For once the mobsters are largely portrayed as nasty, psychotic pricks instead of some Disney like Mr Cool.

Kelly befriends Joanne and takes her to Duncan's mansion. When Joanne cries in the bedroom where she is with Duncan, Kelly runs and defends the girl.

When Derek arrives, Stuart tells that his father is dead and he wants the responsible; further, he cuts his knee sinew to prove that he is not kidding. Derek calls his associate Chum (Nathan Constance) and they begin to chase the girls.<br /><br />The excellent \"London to Brighton\" has a magnificent screenplay that discloses a crude and dark tale of friendship and lost of innocence through flashbacks and a surprising conclusion. This low-budget gem has a stunning cast, with top-notch performances, and the debut of director (and writer) Paul Andrew Williams in a feature could not be better. In the DVD, there is an awesome and cruel alternative ending that should not be deleted, as well the sequence in Duncan's bedroom with the two girls.

Irene even breaks up a marriage between June Forsyte, (Janet Leigh) who was going to marry Philip Bosinney. It is very hard to understand just who Irene really falls in love with, and you will never see the men going to bed with her since this film was made in 1949.", "sentiment": 0}

It showed the public how some CEO's lived in luxurious apartments, have art deco offices, and visited mansions and exotic lands for business. <br /><br />What's nice is to see Jean Harlow as a regular person who is a secretary to the CEO, Clark Gable, who is married to Myra Loy. True is seems unbelievable these glamorous people could be part of the business world but this is Hollywood's version. And to top that, Harlow has a young James Stewart as a struggling boyfriend.

Cynthia is RAW, literally, and she lives for only one thing: physical pleasure. She's an animal, basically, an primal being totally devoid of any domestication, a wildebeast in perpetual heat, and our 'hero' Gordon is both repulsed and attracted (as we are) by Cynthia's blatancy - she's everything he's not, and eventually he submits to her warped energy, her whirlwind of over-indulgence (and of course her sexuality), and for a short while his life has meaning.<br /><br />You realize going in that this film will not turn into yer basic \"and-they-lived-happily-ever-after\" number, so we're not surprised when -=- MINOR SPOILER -=- Gordo finally has had enough; this damsel of the deranged has literally drained him dry and he has to cut her loose.

An hour of random, illogical filler (admittedly with the odd spectacular car wreck) precedes the famous 20 minutes of watching minis do cool stuff and the final 10 minutes is only there to pad the movie to feature length, but the good 20 minutes is a must see!<br /><br />Where does it go wrong? Characters (at least a dozen of them) are introduced from nowhere, appear for 5 minutes and disappear only to be seen at the end cheering or shaking their fists depending on whether they were good or bad. A lot of these characters seem to have jokes reliant on us knowing their personalities, but we don't! How do you get to know a character that's only got 3 lines (albeit stereotypical lines)? It's a case of quantity over quality. Tragic as most of the actors are fine in the quality department, but don't get a chance to demonstrate it. Even Benny Hill only has about 3 minutes screen time! A fin example of how to turn a great ensemble into a great jumble.<br /><br />The first hour consists of random 5 minute bits that make sense within themselves, but don't have anything to do with one another nor do they logically flow. They do go in a general direction, but so much is touched upon , but never explored.<br /><br />Not wanting to give too much away, I'll simply say that the ending is crap. It's a good idea for an ending, but is executed as though it were in front of a blind firing squad.<br /><br />The cinematography is great, particularly for a 60s movie. When a film looks good today, you know it looked great then. The car wrecks look fantastic - proof that you don't need CGI for great action bits, provided you have the money to burn. Too bad what the were shooting was, for the most part, awful.<br /><br />The best recommendation I could give: Skip the first hour, watch the minis do their stuff, then turn it off.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 21998, "text": "It seems everyone loved this movie; I will offer the first dissenting opinion here. Supposedly the 1980's ushered in the \"me\" generation, but after watching this film, one has to wonder if it didn't begin earlier. Lenny Cathrow (Charles Grodin) has got to be one of the most selfish characters on film.<br /><br />He marries a nice enough gal, Lila (Jeannie Berlin, daughter of the director, Elaine May), but almost instantly shows contempt for her - \"buyer's remorse\"? On the third day of his honeymoon, he meets a (rich) spoiled college kid, Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), whose beauty and laugh captivate him. I should mention that Lenny and Lila are New York Jews and Kelly is a blonde mid-Westerner from Minneapolis. The fact that Lenny may never have seen a WASP like Kelly while growing up in the city is hardly an excuse for his actions, and Berlin's character is hardly a stereotypical (repugnant, overindulged) Jewish American Princess.<br /><br />Sure, the road-trip to Miami, during which Lenny all-too-quickly grew to hate his bride (one wonders how he ever chose to marry her in the first place), was hardly ideal. But someone who'd spent three years in the service of his country should show a little more maturity than he does; the story recalls Tennessee Williams's play, and the much better film \"Period of Adjustment (1962)\" - Jim Hutton's character was also ex-military. Suddenly, anything Lila does (almost nothing Lenny shouldn't have noticed while dating) is distasteful to her groom. Is it possible that he was a virgin and we're to believe that their wedding night sex was too disillusioning for him?<br /><br />So, Lenny decides to dump his newlywed wife to pursue Kelly, whose attraction to him is a mystery; it appears she's only toying with the young bridegroom until the incredible (and disappointing) end when he wins her away from her disapproving father (Eddie Albert, his performance being the film's only highlight).

The second Cinderella was cute, but lacked originality and seemed lacklustre in quality. I watched this worried that it would be worse than Cinderella 2, which I still think is one of the weaker Disney sequels, and guess what? It was a huge improvement over the second in all departments. The animation is colourful and fluid, and on the whole beautifully done, with some very memorable scenes. And I really liked the music, true it isn't like the beautiful Tchaikovsky-inspired melodies of the original, but it is memorable and a notable improvement over the awful contemporary songs in Cinderella 2 that felt uninspired and rushed. I wish the mice had more screen time though, they were so cute in this one. The story is very clever and beautifully constructed, the writing is excellent, there are some inspired life lessons that don't preach, and the voice acting from all involved especially from Tress McNeille and Jennifer Hale is fantastic. And Lady Tremaine is a real villainess here. The film however is too short, there could have been more of the secondary characters like the King and the Duke and one or two scenes felt rushed.

Actually, Mr. Chaney's arms are tightly girdled to his chest; he suffers from an obvious deformity, which would identify him to authorities - he has two thumbs on his left hand. Evidently a victim of sex abuse, Ms. Crawford has an unusual fear of arms; so, she rejects the advances of circus strongman Norman Kerry (as Malabar the Mighty). Instead, she warms up to the armless Chaney. He mistakes Crawford's affection for love, and decides to make himself her ideal, by amputating his arms!

Browning builds great suspense in the wonderful ending, wherein he winds up disturbing images in your mind, and teasingly leaves them on the verge of exploding - as usual, the horror unseen is the most unsettling.

Of course, no one can match Chaney; though great throughout, his scene realizing Crawford never truly loved him is emotionally wrenching.

{"id": 36549, "text": "The made for TV film Primal Force begins with Frank Brodie (Ron Pearlman) waking up from a recurring nightmare about his mate being killed by some Baboons. There is a knock on Frank's door, he answers it & standing before him is a guy named Scott Davis (Mark Kiely) who has been told that he knows San Miguel Island better than anyone else & that he needs his help to lead a rescue mission as a plane recently crashed there. Eventually Brodie agrees, together with a female medic named Tara Matthews (Roxana Zal) a computer guy named Stan Kovacs (Julian Sedgwick) & Eddie Mendoza (Guillermo Rios) who carries a gun, gets in the way & does very little else, they set off for San Miguel Island. Meanwhile on the Island itself the three survivors, the pilot (Jimy Hefner), a real estate guy named Deutsch (Richard Fancy) & a pretty young girl named Kelsey Cunningham (Kimberlee Peterson) whose Father is interested in buying the Island, are deciding what to do when a group of vicious genetically altered Baboons kill the pilot. Kelsey & Deutsch just sort of run away. Our heavily armed group of rescuers, lead by Brodie, arrive on the Island via boat. Scott feels Brodie is withholding some information but they troop on regardless of all the human & animal skulls they find. They find Kelsey & Deutsch but they are all attacked by the genetic Baboons. The Baboons now know they're on the Island & will stop at nothing to kill the intruders as Brodie has to use his experience & firepower to keep everyone alive, with varying degrees of success. If that wasn't enough the guy (Bruno Danza) driving the boat has buggered off leaving them stranded & the Baboons have killed Kovacs & destroyed the radio equipment. As the survivors run low on ammo & morale they decide to fight back against the Baboons!<br /><br />Directed by Nelson McCormick I thought Primal Force was an OK time waster but nothing that overly impressed me. The script by Micheal Thoma is about as clichéd as you expect of this sort of low budget TV production. First the characters, there's the moody, unshaven hero with personal demons to exorcise but turns out be be a throughly decent chap in the end, the clean cut hero, the computer whizz, the tough female character, the token nobody who is there to die & nothing else just so something happens & the character who has other more mysterious motives for being on the Island. The innocent plane crash victims aren't any better with the young pretty girl who screams a lot & the annoying selfish fat guy who doesn't care about anyone but himself. Then there's the story, a group becomes stranded in an isolated location & can't call for help, sound familiar? Group encounter living threat that wants to kill them all for no real reason at all, group run low on ammo even though they never actually run out & have to come up with other ways to defeat their enemy in a nail-biting (not) climax, been done yeah? Genetic experiments gone wrong. One character who gets abducted by the enemy & is not killed for some unexplained reason unlike everyone else who are killed on sight. You probably get the message. Having said all that for what it is I thought Primal Force was OK & rolled out the clichés with a certain degree of entertainment value. Ron Pearlman as the muscle bound, wise cracking Brodie is great & almost makes Primal Force worth watching on his own, everyone else is utterly forgettable. Unfortunately one area where Primal Force loses a couple of stars is in the violence department, basically it hasn't got any. This was obviously made with a fairly young teenage audience in mind as the blood, gore & nastiness is kept to an absolute minimum. The killer Baboons are just people in monkey suits, nothing particularly spectacular. Technically Primal Force is OK, it's very MTV in style with quick cuts, jerky hand held camera movements during the attacks, slow motion, bleached colours & every other flashy pointless trick you can think of. On the plus side the Mexican locations on occasion look stunning & a few nice shots here & there captures it well. Overall Primal Force isn't particularly good, but it ain't particularly bad either just sort of average & I think a decent helping of blood & gore would have helped no end to improve it!", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 7819, "text": "Written directly for the screen this horror film has a captivating and staggering story. Almost every scene from beginning till ending is full of action and tension sequences, which are done by good camera work. Its way of storytelling is very smooth. I watched it with subtitles; even though the script is very substantial, it isn't necessary to follow up each conversation. The dialogue and connection which Pablo and Malena established together magnetizes the full attention from the viewer, since their body language and gestures were complementary with the screenplay.<br /><br />The story takes place in August 2001 in Argentina. Pablo and Malena, who are in their mid-20s', are siblings from a dysfunctional family. Their father whom Pablo never seen in his life before, is in coma. They visit him and Malena introduces him to Pablo. Malena has grown hatred for his father, for he served under Anti-Communist Dictatorship of the Argentinian army to quench the communist movement torturing thousands of innocents, instead of looking after his family. There is a huge question mark here: Why are all the communists introduced as innocents in this film? <br /><br />The frightening fact here is that when Pablo and Malena think that their father is helpless in coma, he turns out to be more powerful than he was alive. His spirit continues to torture the restless souls of the dead innocents. He has written a detailed diary including how he tortured the families of communist vanguards when he was young. In return to his weakened body, he bargains with one or more daemons to continue on his dictatorship mission. One of the daemons in the look of a little girl finds this diary from where he hided away. Then Pablo, the curious and adventurous one of the siblings, gets this diary from that daemon, assuming that it was something the little girl lost. So the daemon begins to bugger around Pablo and Malena. The diary which has the curse of the daemon brings only trouble to them.<br /><br />Aparecidos has the meaning for \"Seen versus Disappeared\". Who is seen is the Dictatorship regime runners, and who is disappeared is the slaughtered rebels against this regime. Soon, Pablo and Malena read the diary and start a journey to save the victims of the murderers. One of the communist vanguards ,who has never been captured by the police due to the lack of evidence, has been killed with his pregnant wife and little daughter in the hands of Pablo and Malena's father. Daemon completes the bargain with continuously torturing the wife and the daughter's souls.<br /><br />When you feel like you accomplished something, you think that you must be happy and be proud. Then suddenly you realize that you didn't accomplish anything; the confusion in your mind and senses leads you realize the fact that you just decoded something hidden. That was Pablo's confusion in the movie. When he was explaining to her sister what he was really trying to do, he says that he was gone out of his mind and trying to save someone whoever is dead already. Every night at the same hour in the same motel in the same room, the same murder takes place involving the same dead corpses continuously for the last 20 years. Who are you going to save?

Our protagonist thinks love is a myth. He opposes marriage on any grounds later to his childhood sweetheart Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner of \"Juno\") when they collide with each other again at the wedding rehearsal dinner for his kid brother Paul (Breckin Meyer of \"Road Trip\") and future wife Sandra (Lacey Chabert of \"Black Christmas\") in Newport.<br /><br />As far as Connor sees it, \"marriage is an archaic and oppressive institution that should have been abolished years ago.\" As for love, Connor reviles it as \"magical comfort food for the weak and the uneducated. Furthermore, he insists \"love leaves you weak, dependent, and fat.\" A bespectacled Michael Douglas enters the action about 18 minutes later steals the show as Connor's recently deceased Uncle Wayne. Connor is standing in the men's room when Uncle Wayne materializes at a urinal and relieves himself. When Connor tries to touch him to prove that Uncle Wayne is only a figment of his imagination, Uncle Wayne shrinks away from him: \"Don't touch a man when he is hanging a wire.\" The worldly, wise, but very dead Uncle Wayne has returned to help Connor mend his ways. \"Tonight,\" he informs Connor, \"things are gonna change.\" Uncle Wayne explains: \"Tonight you're going to be visited by three ghosts.\" Wayne assures Connor, \"and you're going to be forced to feel things that you haven't felt for a long time.\" Later, when Connor goes to his bedroom for a rendezvous, he finds red-headed Allison Vandermeersh (Emma Stone of \"Superbad\") waiting for him. Allison was Connor's first sexual score. She tells Connor she plans to take him back through allhis past girlfriends and help him figure out how he got his head stuck so far up his hindquarters. We learn that Jenny gave Connor his first camera, and Connor's pursuit and initial loss of Jenny prompted him to seek advice from Uncle Wayne. Years later Connor hooks up with Jenny and makes the mistake of not snuggling with her after sex. He sneaks off into the night and she doesn't speak to him again until ten years afterward when they meet at Paul's wedding. Not sooner has Allison--the ghosts of girlfriends past--left him than his girl Friday Melanie (Noureen De Wulf of \"The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard\") appear as the ghost of girlfriends present. The real problem with \"The Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\" is that McConaughey and Jennifer Garner lack charismatic chemistry as a couple. This is basically a conservative, Republican style stab at marriage that spouts anti-gay ideology. The wedding cake scene is funny and McConaughey is well cast as a callous stud with lots of eye-candy babes parading around him.

Of course, I realize there were many changes made in the earlier episodes, but here are a couple of reasons why: <br /><br />1. The three Indian books give us a good look at the very young Sharpe and the formation of his character.

The suspects are a honeymooning couple (Herbert Lom and Patricia Medina), a man using an alias (Frederick Valk), an attractive young woman (Mary Skelton), a major (Anthony Shaw), an older couple, several others.<br /><br />I liked this film a little better than some others on the board, though it does not have the suspense or urgency of a Hitchcock film. It does have an overpowering score, one of the most dramatic I've ever heard by Lennox Berkeley, interesting photography by Mutz Greenbaum (who was one of the directors as Max Greene), and it's based on a story by Eric Ambler, a fine suspense writer. What it also had going for it was a very European setting and sensibility, very fitting for the plot.<br /><br />James Mason is very young and handsome here, and Herbert Lom is nearly unrecognizable, he's so young. Mason is very good but the depth of his abilities was as yet untapped. The rest of the cast is good.<br /><br />Yes, Hitchcock would have gone to town on this one. Still, \"Hotel Reserve\" has its good points in storyline and visuals. And that music - intrusive but good.", "sentiment": 0}

If anything the premise is even more believable now than it was 26 years ago. In that sense it was a pretty darn accurate bit of future prediction in terms of where our video and computer technology was going.<br /><br />I've always liked this movie. It stands as a classic underrated film and a fond memory of my childhood. I took two points off though, one for each of the two problems I have with it: <br /><br />First, they didn't provide enough motivation or explanation for killing the models. One of them seemed to have figured out what was really going on, so that makes sense. But the others? Was it just to avoid paying out their contracts? They made a point of saying how rich the RI company was, so the cost would seem to be trivial in comparison to murder.<br /><br />Second, it struck me as odd that they could accurately digitize human beings but they still shot the commercials on a real set. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Even today it's much easier to model a kitchen than it is to model a human being.<br /><br />Overall though it's still a solid and enjoyable flick. You could make this movie today and it would be a perfectly good film for 2007.", "sentiment": 0}

Brian is one of the most dysfunctional, manipulative, abusive egomaniacs I have ever seen (even on t.v.) - and he stated that he is a psychologist??!!?? These women are nothing short of victims. Pam - the subservient, non-confrontational pleaser, Kathy - the insecure other woman, and Denise - clearly abused in previous relationships and feels she doesn't deserve a decent man. As other commenters have remarked, the children have lost the most and will carry the dysfunction consciously brought on by their ignorant parents for the remainder of their lives. I can almost understand polygamy for religious reasons (while recognizing the welfare fraud, statutory rape, and other associated criminal acts that commonly accompany this lifestyle), but this pig of a human openly states that his polygamy has nothing to do with religion - just his inability to keep his organ in his pants. The only redeeming moment was when Denise finally left (even if it was not of her own doing). At least she stands a chance at getting some counseling for her self-esteem issues. It is disappointing that TLC would air such a low class show. To give them the benefit of the doubt, though, perhaps they were hoping to shed some light on abusive relationships. They could have done a better job of it, though. Would I ever watch this again? No way. It was a complete waste of one hour of my life.

{"id": 31488, "text": "I am sure you would be wondering why I am reviewing a movie which was released more than 1 1/2 years ago...truth be told, I was not much inclined to watch this mega-budget, megastar portrayal of the legendary love story of Emperor Akbar & Jodha...the reason behind this is that neither Hrithik Roshan, nor Aishwarya Rai feature on my list of watchable actors...I attribute their success more to their good looks, shrewd career moves and a healthy dose of sheer good luck...<br /><br />I did not have much of a choice when my brother-in-law bought a CD of this movie home & my wife insisted that we should view it as a family...I have been hearing rave reviews till now & so was just a little bit intrigued...however after sitting through the entire movie, I am wondering what the hype was all about...without doubt, this is an above-average film and has been made with a lot of care & effort....however does it deserve all the accolades heaped on it...can I, for once, cry out \"The Emperor has no clothes\"? Let's take a look at the various reasons why I am panning this movie - 1) Hrithik, with his chocolate boy good looks & razor-sharp features is Bollywood star material...however he does not fit in the stereotype of a powerful Mughal Emperor...when you think about Akbar, a powerfully built, swarthy & regal figure springs to mind and Hrithik is anything but...with his soft, melting eyes he looks more like the poster boy of movies such as Dhoom 2 & Krish...<br /><br />Instead an unknown actor with a commanding presence would have better suited this role...I think Hrithik would be more suited to play the part of Jehangir, in a historic movie, as Jehangir was known to be a typical ladies man...<br /><br />2) Aishwarya Rai as a Rajput princess is a joke...same as Hrithik, she lacks the stature to play such a part...she is pure eye candy...her voice is weak & she sounds absurd delivering her lines...my choice to play this part would have been Sushmita Sen...<br /><br />3) The plot of this movie is 2/3rds pure fantasy...Akbar did not have a wife by the name of Jodha...he married a Rajput princess called Hira Kunwar, who promptly converted to Islam and was called Mariam-ul-zamani...she was one of Akbar's many wives and bore him his heir apparent Jehangir...<br /><br />4) It is not evident whether the director meant for this film to be a love saga or a political drama...too many sub-plots spring out throughout the length of the movie, but get resolved quickly & conveniently...it seems the director wanted to pack in as much masala as possible, culminating in an unnecessary fight scene...<br /><br />5) Akbar's birth name was Badruddin Mohammed Akbar, after his grandfather Shaikh Ali Akbar and \"Akbar\" was not a title conferred on him...<br /><br />5) Akbar was better known as a master strategian & shrewd administrator, not for his chiseled physique...he was also not monogamous as is depicted in the movie, but like other emperors of his time had innumerable wives & concubines...though he has been painted as being broad-minded & liberal as compared to other Mughals, Akbar was far from the benign & forgiving monarch portrayed here...he was responsible for slaughtering thousands of men, women & children, destroying hundreds of temples & ransacking scores of towns & villages...finally no Indian emperor would be fool hardy enough to challenge his adversary to single combat & stake his entire kingdom on the outcome of the fight...<br /><br />6) The battle scenes are evidently inspired by (read - copied from) Hollywood movies such as Troy & Alexander...however after watching the realistic, gruesome wars depicted in the latter, these appear as tame, watered down versions...the climatic confrontation in this movie reminds too much of the awe-inspiring stand off between Hector & Achilles in Troy...<br /><br />I admired Ashutosh Gowarikar for his original & entertaining Lagaan and also for his thought-provoking, soul stirring Swades...Aamir & Shahrukh Khan managed to get in the skin of the characters they were playing to such an extent that after watching these movies, you do not remember the stars, you only remember Bhuvan & Mohan Bhargav...here, you are only watching Hrithik who has played romantic lead in several other movies...seems like Ashutosh has succumbed to the practice of making politically correct, commercially successful movies...<br /><br />However, to give the devil his due & end on a positive note, several events in the movie are portrayed accurately...the look of the movie is grand...Mughal & Rajput cultures are depicted in royal splendour...dialogues are well written...some of the characters seem to have walked out of a history text book page...weapons & jewellery used have a very realistic look...", "sentiment": 0}

I read today that the ratings are down to 118k average for the season so far. Which means, at some point, the ratings dropped to about 90 thousand people, across the whole of Canada, who paid for this. It doesn't get much worse than that. An astonishing .25% of Canadians are watching this show (ONE QUARTER OF ONE PERCENT). It cost us HOW MUCH? As a point of fact, the ratings have been dropping through the floor since the premier episode, falling off an incredible 40%! Some people gave it a chance, then fled after seeing how worthless it was. If this were in the US, it would be yanked immediately and never heard from again.

It's actually a pretty entertaining b-movie, but following on the heels of the amazing Corman production 'Galaxy of Terror', this is a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />The \"'Alien' rip-off\" label is a bit of a misnomer, since 'Alien' is itself a rip-off of 'Planet of the Vampires', but accurate in that yes, the plot is basically the same, the setting being a genetic research station on a planet that just happens to also have the exact same rock formation that Captain Kirk fought the Gorn on in the classic 'Star Trek' episode 'Arena'! If that doesn't excite you...<br /><br />...This might. Dawn Dunlap and June Chadwick play really hot scientists and they get naked... a lot. They bathe each other in some weird, psychedelic shower scene, at one point. Actually, these scenes are really the highlight of the film. The smaller scale effects actually look good as well, and some cool death sequences result, but the large scale creature is pretty hilarious. The exterior visual effects are well done, too. The dialogue is good for a laugh or three. It sometimes comes off as parody or schtick, which is what Jim Wynorski usually goes for, and director Allan Holtzman seems to be playing along occasionally, but he could have tried a little harder to be either scarier or funnier. A couple of familiar faces in the cast... The doctor is played by Fox Harris, from 'Repo Man', and the guy that dies first in this movie was the first to die in another 80's cult classic, \"Night of the Comet\". Jesse Vint is the bland, but okay protagonist, always scoping for some space booty.<br /><br />The score was great. It's similar to the other 80's synthesizer scores Jim Wynorski used in 'Chopping Mall' and his classic remake of 'Not of This Earth'.<br /><br />It's worth a watch if you're an 80's b-movie fan.

{"id": 46414, "text": "Ah, the wondrous mysteries of late 70's/early 80's Euro-exploitation cinema With almost a 100% positive certainty, the script of this film was improvised along whilst shooting. Judging by the tone and cheerful atmosphere of the opening sequences, it doesn't even look like the creators (Alain Deruelle and Julio Tabernero) ever intended to make a movie about cannibals, but maybe the producers forced them in order to quickly cash in on the gigantic success of contemporary horror-hits like \"Cannibal Holocaust\" and \"Cannibal Ferox\". As you probably know, everything was possible in the exploitation industry, even hiring the notorious smut filmmaker Jess Franco to shoot some additional footage. The film opens with a rhythmic and jolly carnival song, introduces several comical characters and a potentially interesting (but poorly elaborated) kidnapping/ransom plot. The cannibal tribe and obligatory grossness only kicks in after about 40 minutes and comes across as totally ridiculous. Three amateur thugs, one voluptuous woman and two guys, randomly decide to abduct the daughter of a wealthy businessman and demand a ransom. When one of their accomplices gets involved in a banal car accident, they flee towards the jungle (I think the South American) and seek shelter in the hut of a friend. Nearby there's a tribe of primitive cannibals, but they appear to remain politely within their perimeters. Only when one of the thugs rapes the lady of the house, her husband almost literally feeds them to the cannibals. Meanwhile, the parents of the kidnapped girl have also arrived in the jungle (don't ask me how, though), but they're good people and hence don't get eaten. Needless to say \"Cannibal Terror\" is an incredibly bad film and I honestly can't name one good element, apart maybe from the jolly theme song. Sure, there's a bit of nasty gore, but there's absolutely no prior tension building and the actual munching goes on for far too long. You know you're in trouble when even the gory bits in a movie are dull. The acting performances are atrocious. The lines of the little girl are practically inaudible and I'm pretty sure an adult woman imitating the voice of a child spoke them. The \"jungle\" setting is quite hilarious, as the film is clearly shot in someone's home garden and the \"natives\" are plain white day-players.

{"id": 41947, "text": "I saw this movie because it seemed like a good plot, I'm a horror fan, and I always take time to watch the movies of Dawson's Creek stars. It was a good idea to make a film about teens being brain-washed but I guess the producers assumed that since Katie Holmes was in the movie there was no need to actually put some work into the script.<br /><br />The actors, leaving out Nick Stahl, were lacking. James Marsden could have done better but it could have just been that the dialogue was poorly written. Who knows. Katie Holmes' bad girl act made her just seem like a bratty little tag-along.<br /><br />And of course they had to add some nudity to the flick just to make it \"perfect\". The showing of the girl's chest wasn't at all necessary.<br /><br />All in all, it was just a typical teen horror flick that was sloppily made. All pretty much done was taking a spookie urban legend, throw in some nudity, some running around into nowhere, an extremely popular star, and making a happy ending with a little corny twist at the end... BOOM... you just got yourself a poorly done teen flick. Rent The Faculty instead unless you are partial to Katie Holmes. I give this movie a 3/10 stars.", "sentiment": 0}

When you are done reading it you get this sense of confusion, like you should have understood it, but you just didn't. So you are tempted to read it again to see what you must have missed, however, you don't, because you come to your senses and don't want to waste your time. That's exactly the feeling you'll get while watching this movie. Try chugging a beer each time someone in the movie stiffly says \"keyless encryption,\" and you'll feel much better. The acting is so poor the script reaches the level of self-parody, which is tough to do by mistake. However, writer/director/exec. producer Hank Whetstone has no problem. (See his other credits...oh, umm, there are none. This will remain his greatest achievement.) Yes, the cover has Apache helicopters, although none appear in the movie. Yes, ending the movie in the Bahamas was just an excuse to take the crew on vacation. Yes, when a plane gets blown up by a rocket, the entire sequence takes place off camera, saving the FX dept their whole budget. But it's the script that brings the real laughs. If I was running from someone w/a gun, would I run to an empty beach? What on earth went on with that beach scene? All of a sudden there are two-discs? Am I missing something? Ahh, someone just said \"keyless encryption.\" Another cold one downed. I was tempted to rewind it, but came to my senses.<br /><br />Upon reading some of the newer high praise for this movie, it have recognized that: A. Almost all were written in the first few months of 2005, many in March. B. Almost all have overseas cities listed. C. Almost all of the glowing reviews look they were written by dweebs on shrooms.<br /><br />From this I can only gather either that: 1. This movie has authentically reached cult-status for its poor quality. Or 2. A bunch of nerds got together and watched the movie on the TV in the back of one of their mom's garage, and the one girl invited there who was not half good looking but the rest wanted to make out with in the back of their '97 Neon anyway said something remotely positive about the movie and they wanted to impress her with incoherent dribble posted online.

{"id": 3679, "text": "A vanload of kids driving across the country run afoul of a crazed degenerate family of vicious redneck killers in remote rural Texas. That's it for the (admittedly slight) set-up, but the plot is basically inconsequential as this one's really all about creating and sustaining a supremely dark, grim, and unsparingly harsh mood that gets under your skin and makes you squirm like a hapless fish caught on a hook. Director Tobe Hooper's masterful talent for crafting a raw, rattling and uncompromisingly fierce intensity that slowly, yet surely builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch in the harrowing last third (the infamous diner table sequence is particularly horrifying) has never been matched or surpassed in either any of the subsequent sequels or in the needless and atrocious overly graphic remake. Hooper's strong evocation of the bleak, dusty and desolate Texas backwoods projects a profound sense of dread and unease which never lets up for a minute. Moreover, Hooper's wise decision to keep the violence largely off-screen enhances rather than detracts from the film's alarming power to scare and disturb; this welcome and refreshing concession to the viewer's imagination ensures that the movie never deteriorates into a mindless and revolting bloodbath while still allowing the jolting outbursts of sudden brutal violence to retain their ability to startle the audience. The admirable refusal to provide some kind of explanation for why the horrific goings-on occur qualifies as another major asset; instead Hooper and co-writer Kim Henkel merely present a stark and unwavering depiction of random gratuitous violence and unbridled savagery as if such horrible things happen all the time. This movie is further enhanced by a wickedly funny sense of black-as-coal gallows humor, with the loony hick clan -- the weary, bitter old man (marvelously played by Jim Siedow), unhinged hitchhiker (a deliciously batty portrayal by Edwin Neal), and the freakish, squealing, gibbering Leatherface (an astonishingly bestial and bloodcurdling Gunnar Hansen) -- serving as a strikingly grotesque caricature of your typical American family. Marilyn Burns makes for a fetching and pitiable luckless damsel-in-distress as Sally while Paul A. Partain contributes a memorably obnoxious performance as the extremely whiny, hateful and unsympathetic cripple Franklin. Kudos are also in order for the wondrous wealth of inspired macabre touches: a chicken in a birdcage, the armchair made out of human bones, and the aged grandfather (John Dugan in hideously wizened make-up) who drinks human blood. The spare, droning and dissonant experimental score by Hooper and Wayne Bell adds substantially to the picture's considerable unsettling impact. Daniel Pearl's grainy, but polished cinematography offers several smooth and sinuous tracking shots that are positively breathtaking to behold. Essential viewing.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 28667, "text": "I am a WWII buff (and history in general as well). This series (hardly a \"mini\") covers both the European and Pacific theaters of WWII thru the eyes of the Victor Henry family. Not only is it a very interesting story about the lives of these specific people, but also tells a lot about WWII and it inhumanity. So, on both accounts it is excellent, and depicts most of the WWII major events, although not all equally.<br /><br />Back in those days, there was no CGI, so what you see is either real life, or models. Obviously, the war scenes are a combination of both, but very well done so you believe you are actually there in the battles, on the ships, or in the planes.<br /><br />While this series (War & Remembrance) is 6 DVD's (30 hours), I was striving for more when it was all done. I watched it when it was aired in 1988/1989, so it was not new for me from the DVD set. Nonetheless, I was still captivated, and will gladly watch it again. The sound is also updated and very good (DD 5.1).<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who cares to look into WWII and its horrors. It gets a bit graphic with the Jewish persecution and extermination, but doesn't touch on the horrors commented by the Japanese in the Pacific. So, if this sort of realism offends, either skip over those parts or don't watch it. But remember, the name of the book (and hence, of the series) was so designed and selected such that we as a human race never forget all the terrible things that happened and that caused so much world pain and destruction.<br /><br />Jane Seymour, John Gigliold, and Robert Mitchum are all excellent and make you believe they were these people.

But just through his portrayal of Mr. Rochester in this adaptation of Jane Eyre, he has undermined my love for his acting. If I were him, I would refuse to play Rochester in the manner he has done in this movie.<br /><br />There are far too many things deviant and completely improbable in this movie.

Jaci Velasquez is a Christian artist and notice that her theatrical debut is a PG movie and how she wore the one-piece bathing suit and otherwise maintained a modest demeanor alongside her co-stars. Another reason to consider Ms. Velasquez a role model for teens and to applaud Fox for not offering up an over-sexed first attempt to draw in Latino crowds.<br /><br />Unfortunately the plot is somewhat vapid which is why I don't necessarily recommend the movie other than for its pivotal place in a movement that is gaining momentum.", "sentiment": 0}

The storyline and writing style is a breath of fresh air and the book, \"the Dark is Rising\" rapidly became my favourite read. Even now, 27 years later it has lost none of its appeal and my own children are enjoying it too. The secret of success is in the way it creates magic not out of stereotyped wizards (a la Harry Potter), but out of the honest descriptions of the events that unfold for Will Stanton. The description of his village and countryside and how they change as Will himself develops. Above all it is quintessentially English and far from being dated it is a timeless masterpiece as relevant to children now as 30 years ago. The interweaving of Arthurian legend with local Chiltern folk-lore does not need special effects and the story itself is perfect for a film without plot changes. So, to make a film that changes characters as significantly as this does, omitting some, radically altering others, changing the whole substance of Will's family is unforgivable. The casting is poor - Ian McShane is no Merriman.

{"id": 44727, "text": "This movie generated so much buzz when it came out that I initially resisted seeing it. Now that I finally did, I can't help but wonder what all the hype was about.<br /><br />Starring Meryl Streep opposite Anne Hathaway, \"The Devil Wears Prada\" is loosely based on the book by the same name, and was billed as a funny-but-edgy insider's look into the cutthroat world of fashion. Instead, it is a fairly pedestrian teen movie, built along the lines of \"She's All That\" or its million predecessors, where the plain Jane girl gets a makeover and all her dreams come true. Or something.<br /><br />Because the message itself gets a little lost here. Ostensibly, this movie is supposed to tell us that the world of fashion is evil, superficial, full of back-stabbers and snotty \"clackers\", and utterly devoid of any true meaning or purpose. But simultaneously, it tries to elevate fashion to a worthy pursuit on the same level as, say, curing AIDS or fighting world poverty. In trying to at once pay homage to and dissect the fashion world, the movie succeeds at neither.<br /><br />Much has been said about the acting, namely, Meryl Streep's portrayal of her character. And while I agree that her deliberately understated performance elevated this movie to something beyond \"disaster\", I'd hardly give her lavish praise. Simply put, she's not nearly \"devilish\" enough. She's tough and, at first, snarky, but we never truly believe that she's evil. Driven, yes. Willing to step over people to get what she wants, sure. But evil?<br /><br />In fact, nobody is quite mean enough here. Emily Blunt's character is snooty but ultimately likable, and Stanley Tucci plays the kind of \"gal pal\" every girl wishes she had. For a supposedly cutthroat world, people are falling all over themselves to help each other out. So much for the Devil.<br /><br />And Anne Hathaway is charming and all, but she is just horribly miscast as the ugly duckling. She's a gorgeous girl who looks like a fashion model wearing the designer clothing she struts around in most of the movie, but she looked stunning even before that \"makeover\" and the suggested message was that the world of fashion has ridiculous, unrealistic standards. <br /><br />That said, the movie never really passes enough judgment on these standards. When her success at work leads her to drive away those closest to her, the movie portrays her in a sympathetic light, and her boyfriend and her friends are portrayed as simply jealous, as opposed to as real people who love her for who she is and not for what she wears. When Hathaway's character proudly boasts that she's dropped from a size 6 to a size 4, it's done in such a way to make viewers believe that this is actually a good thing! Far from inspiring people to do the right thing, I fear all this movie will inspire is an epidemic of anorexia among young girls.<br /><br />In the world of The Devil Wears Prada, there are no consequences, no shame, and no sore feet from running around town all day wearing ridiculous shoes. The plot is utterly ridiculous, including such impossible situations as Hathaway's character obtaining the (not yet written) manuscript to the seventh Harry Potter book. Can we at least stick to something with some semblance of reality here, people? <br /><br />Salma Hayek's adaptation of \"Betty La Fea\" as \"Ugly Betty\", starring America Ferrera, takes the same concept and does it quite a bit better, to tell the truth. I'd give this a skip and try watching the TV series instead; whatever its faults, at least it has a bit more heart than this mess.", "sentiment": 0}

{"id": 12140, "text": "My Dinner With Andre is a rewarding film that was far ahead of its time in not just style but topics and social commentary. Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn, apparently playing themselves in the two leading roles in which for almost two hours they sit in a restaurant and engage in a completely believable conversation ranging from the surreal to the social to the metaphysical also write the film. This is a key contribute for why the film works because having written the material the actors appear to know it inside and out and therefore give it that extra sense of naturalism. The introduction also perfectly sets up the situation we are going to find ourselves in for the next two hours; it shows Wallace going about his normal, mundane activities, expressing discontent with his life and how he has to see his old friend Andre for the first time in years. Once they actually get into the dialogue it becomes apparent the script has vast layers to it, it essentially is a comment on modern existence and the conflicting views held by people, it uses the two characters in the film as symbols of society; Andre representing the new age thinking, while Wallace represents the rational scientific mind and shows the conflicting desire of wanting to retreat back to primitive living to find our humanity but also wanting to enjoy the benefits modern society grants us. The conversation as a whole is very well executed; the modest performances by the two actors never seeps into the overly dramatic, they maintain a natural flow and make it entertaining, challenging and realistic throughout. Some viewers may find it pretentious at first viewing, because it does deal with a lot of hard thinking topics and at times it can alienate the viewer by going slightly overboard with how it presents its ideas but most viewers should be able to relate to a conversation similar to this at one at some point in their lives, just maybe in a different way.<br /><br />The major flaw of the film is undoubtedly the camera-work, this is especially worrying with a film like this because in theory this should be one the most easiest films in history to shoot but instead of simply taking a subtle approach and showing the characters through two or three angles, the camera will suddenly jerk from one shot to the next in a very disorientated manner. While this doesn't ruin the film it can make you loose concentration during a segment of the dialogue and possibly miss an important part of the conversation, lessening its impact. Its possible the director introduced these jerks to give the camera-work greater variety, but when you already have a script that is as tough and deep as this, pioneering cinematography should not be a major concern.<br /><br />If you have seen films like 'Before Sunrise' or any other dialogue rich film and found yourself interested in who these characters are and what their thoughts on specific topics are I would suggest giving My Dinner with Andre a go. It kept my attention for the full two hours, which for a film almost completely composed of two characters and a restaurant table is an accomplishment in itself. The script is intelligent and thought provoking with excellent performances from Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory bringing it to life. Just be wary of some of the crazy camera-work that can jump out of nowhere and you should hopefully enjoy a thoroughly unique experience.", "sentiment": 0}

Those of you who --like me-- who were looking for the ultimate Twilight Zone episode will not be disappointed. It is a love story. It has a love of language. It is complex. It is beautifully acted. It breathes (it is nearly 3 hours long because it had to be).

There are frames in this film that I could stare at for long, long minutes rather than the few seconds that they appear on screen.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />No movie works if the story doesn't grab you.

What this film does so well is connect you with the protagonists in a simple, yet very effect manner. Once the initial setup and character introductions are complete, the rest of the film is spent following them through the harsh wilderness. In doing so, Lu Chuan places the viewer in the same dire situation as the mountain patrol. We're with them as they brave harsh winds, freezing water, sun-baked plains, and treacherous, snow-covered mountains. We feel their anguish as they come under attack from seemingly invisible assailants. We sense their fear and pessimism as they struggle to survive in this breathtakingly beautiful, yet ultimately deadly landscape. All this to protect Tibetan antelope. The fact that they're willing to risk everything for this unseen animal says more about their character than any amount of dialogue. They do this without a paycheck and with the knowledge that they'll probably have little to no success. By giving the antagonist so little screen time, Lu Chuan is able to broaden this story and give it global context, declaring that attitudes and actions such as this should be condemned outright. It also serves to elevate the protagonists above ordinary heroes as it can be interpreted that they're not just doing this for the Tibetan antelope, but endangered animals everywhere.<br /><br />Kekexili is an enormously powerful film that should not be missed.

The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite.

This movie is awful beyond all known definitions of the term. People with a low tolerance for inept cinema are likely to faint or even die from a stroke during the first half hour already and even experienced bad movie fanatics will, in fact, face severe difficulties to sit through R.O.T.O.R from start to finish. Imagine everything  and I do mean every slightest thing  that can go wrong in a film, and you pretty much have an apt description of R.O.T.O.R. We're talking basic story ideas that desperately attempt to cash-in on previous blockbusters (\"The Terminator\", \"Robocop\") abominable acting performances from a largely amateur cast, completely incoherent narrative structure (with flashbacks within flashbacks etc), errors in continuity that are as large as life itself, miserable dialogs and pathetic attempts at inserting comical elements, a soundtrack that makes you want to rip off your ears, \"special\" effects accomplished without any budgetary means and hands down  the most pathetic depiction of a cyborg ever. The guy has a naturally grown mustache, for crying out loud! Scientist slash witty copper Coldyron is working on the ultimate mechanical policeman; the so-called Robotic Officer Tactical Operation Research or, as you guessed, R.O.TO.R. Due to an overload of complaints and work pressure from his superiors, Coldyron abandons the project (how devoted he is) and his incompetent assistants take over. Needless the say the incomplete android breaks loose and goes on a relentless killing spree. Although \"killing spree\" might be a bit exaggerated since he chases a girl in a car most of the time. At some point, still early during the production, I presume the cast & crew realized R.O.T.O.R was going to become a gigantic failure and so they started adding ridicule self-parody and even hugely irritating jokes about everything resembling a \"Bad B-Movie\". Especially the stupid android  behaving as annoying as C3PO from \"Star Wars\" and wearing a police cap on his metal head  ought to shut up! This is surely one of the dumbest movies ever made but, as several of my fellow reviewers already pointed out, it's almost impossible to really hate the film.

This film turned out to be a masterpiece, to be remembered forever in movie history and be ranked with films like \"Godfather\", \"Seven Samurai\" \"What a wonderful life\" Shawshank Redemption\" etc.<br /><br />What a magnificent film... where can I begin? The story? The story draw both destiny of troubled Italy and ordinary middle class Italian family, both Macro and micro story is combined seamless, you will experience and get thorough the turbulence time of Italy and the family from 1960s-2003.<br /><br />All main actors are top class, acting so naturally from their early unresponsively 20s student times to bitter/sweet grey hair late mid age times without false note. Particualry Maya Sansa, I think the Star was born here (her another recent film, \"Good morning, night\" is another evidence). I haven't seen an actress with such a presence and ability in last few years. Needless to say about the lead roles, Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni, both shows such a true resonance of all the emotions. Also, its nice to know 70's Italian movie icon, Adriana Asti still keep that elegance.<br /><br />The greatest thing is the directors sympathetic eye to all the characters. Most of characters are given real three dimension character in the course of 40 years time in this film, all of them have their own life and problems. each character come with such a detail & depth, you will feel like they are your real family at the end of the film. <br /><br />The length of this films seems weakness of it, but actually strongest point lay in there. Because of the length, you are able to feel the passage of 30 years of time in the film, and you can feel characters so close, it grows in you during the film. Towards the end of the film, you may do not want to say good bye to them, don't want film to finish! <br /><br />Like all the masterpiece I mentioned above, this film come with some memorable scene <br /><br />(Warning - Spoiler) <br /><br />Matteo jumps from window - its so abrupt but still make sense, its so realistic -his face are painful before and such a quiet pain he shows that night without any big speech. Nicola and Mirella walking in the forest and Matteo appears and touched them... I never cried that much in the cinema. Not like Hollywood film, this scene doesn't come with any sentimental big music or emotional speech (actually its speechless), its very subtle, still so strongly moving... Giulia met Sarah at church after she released, and Sarah asked Giulia to play church's organ... <br /><br />(Spoiler end)<br /><br />Actually, if you don't want show your friends/family your crying/sobbing face, you should avoid this film all the cost, its that moving, so powerful.<br /><br />Conclusion - true gem, masterpiece.

Here ended the career of the man who would have been President, had his ambitions come to fruition. He would have also been remembered as the American Hitler.<br /><br />I've read historical accounts and military histories of the battle, National Geographic articles on the fascinating forensic examination archaeologists were able to make of the battlefield after grass fires swept away much of the overgrowth. And I've always been fond of saying that I can't watch him die on film enough times.<br /><br />((When he finally sent for Benteen and Reno, he had already charged into the trap: his message was (in part) \"Bring rounds! P.S. BRING ROUNDS!\" They were similarly ensnared in well-planned traps and could do little to help, however, not sitting on their hands protesting their sobriety in the shade of pleasant riverbank trees, let alone to each other: they were not together.)) <br /><br />Well, I just checked this stinker out from the local library, and I take my fond saying back. I've just seen him die one too many times. Or more accurately, I've seen *somebody* flog himself around on screen and *claim* to be Custer. I have no idea where he's flogging around, it certainly doesn't look like the Custer Battlefield -- not even remotely.<br /><br />Benteen is played in one of the worst performances I've ever seen from late and talented Jeffrey Hunter as a simultaneously wooden and spineless gopher; Reno as an incompetent and insubordinate drunken lout. The families of these competent (but overwhelmed) heroic officers should have legal recourse to sue director Siodmak for their portrayals in this travesty.<br /><br />Historically, geographically, politically, this movie crosses the line from \"creative interpretation\" to blatant twisting and reversal of anything resembling facts. Even Custer's portrayal in the wonderful farce, \"Little Big Man\", came much closer to the truth, and the California terrain that stood in for the Little Big Horn region in an old B&W \"Twilight Zone\" time-travel episode was more accurate than this.<br /><br />The whole film seems to have been concocted to give the Cinerama audiences a few roller-coaster moments (a runaway wagon ride, a log flume ride, there were a few forgettable others) and even these went on *long* after they'd already proved their point.<br /><br />A truly awful film.

With all of that in mind, I sat down with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Liam Neesom plays an undercover cop with a failing digestive system after coming too close to death following his last assignment. He plays the part only moderately well, certainly not as well as would be expected when compared to some of his better movies, but nothing to complain about. Oliver Platt was wonderful; he played a loser killer, hopelessly desperate and hating himself. He was a mediocre bad guy, but he was supposed to be a mediocre bad guy. His posing \"mean\" expressions were hilarious and well matched for his character.<br /><br />Don't expect a lot. It has funny lines (such as Neeson describing the dirty details of his job to a mostly yuppie support group), and some visual humor. The plot is tight, but I will say that the love interest (Sandra Bullock, who he meets when he visits for an enema) could have been completely taken out of the movie and it would not have lost anything. She felt like almost an afterthought for how much she contributed to the development of the movie.<br /><br />The ending threw me off as being very far-fetched, but Hollywood will do that in order to get a \"happily ever after\" ending. It tied up the loose ends well but was just a little too hard to believe.<br /><br />Had I watched it in theaters, I might have been disappointed.

He is an ordinary man, and as terrified of the Nazis as any of his neighbors in the ghetto. He blunders his way into his unlikely role as a keeper of hope, and once there, cannot see from moment to moment how he can maintain it, wishes at times he could be rid of the burden, and yet somehow, manages to continue to inspire others who are so desperate for hope, they don't even try to disbelieve. In short, don't be fooled by the title: Jakob is just this guy; plotwise, he is only a hub around which a large wheel turns. <br /><br />There were parts that didn't work for me, especially pieces where narration would have worked better than a character monologue (Jakob is a narrator as well as a character, so why does he talk to himself instead of us so much?) But on the whole, it was a good story, well performed by those involved.<br /><br />The ending, which I shall refrain from describing for the benefit of any who have not seen it, is absolutely fitting.

This is even worse than \"Glen or Glenda.\" I hated every simpering, stupid, vacant, idiotic, vapid moment of wasted celluloid. Overall, the script was poor, as was the acting, especially that of a character known only as \"Schooner.\" Not only did he look out of place, but he had a funny voice, and was just not entertaining in the least. When he says, \"Mayonnaise, O NAYS MAY!\" I was only left wondering \"What?\" My advice is that the cast and crew should not quit their day jobs. And if these are their day jobs, may they all be shot like the leads at the end of the film. They should also not be allowed to reproduce, as it would be hazardous to society. There are worse ways to spend your evening, but I can't think of any. Wait, nevermind, this film is wretched. The cinematography is inept, and the shots of New London are unconvincing to say the least. I hope with this directors next film, he will not hire a piece of particle board to play the lead.

Woody Harrelson is an FBI agent who is duped by Brosnan and Hayek and they become his \"white whale.\" The thieves disappear to the Bahamas to retire. Harrelson then catches up to them because a cruise ship is in port that is displaying one of the world's largest diamonds. Don Cheadle, a local mob boss, then attempts to hire Brosnan to steal the diamond for him.<br /><br />The movie is then a series of cat and mouse type charades between Brosnan, Hayek, Harrelson, and Cheadle. The acting is great from all these stars; Harrelson and Cheadle are both hilarious. Also, Naomie Harris absolutely sizzles in her role as local Bahamian cop and love interest to Harrelson.<br /><br />If you like light-hearted thrillers with a little romance thrown in, you will enjoy this film.

This serious role, as well as a different type in the excellent \"Moonstruck,\" display both her competence and versatility.

Just a minor case in point: towards the beginning of the film, as the unloaded crate in which they are hiding is speeding its way from the east coast to Chicago, Lana and Darko look through a hole in the side, and lo and behold what do they happen to see passing by but the capitol building in Washington D.C.! I'm surprised director Michael S. Ojeda was able to resist throwing in shots of the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore and the Grand Canyon as well.

I believe the lack of mystery with the lead character, i.e., the viewer knows who is the killer before watching the film, is the greatest flaw in this screenplay.

However, I have never heard about this Romasanta, and the writer used fictional and historical events to write this story, with elements of horror and romance.

The story seems secondary to musical interludes and drinking games. What is even more puzzling is the attempted rape scene near the end of the film. It is quite dark and does not suit the film at all. It is as if they tried to rip off \"Halloween\" momentarily too, just to rack in a quick buck.<br /><br />It is somewhat of a shame that this movie is so poorly made. There are a few decent things going for it. The music is in the same vein as The Ramones's music in \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\", and evokes some feelings of nostalgia. The best part of the film though, are a few of the female leads. Ileana Seidel as the spunky Brooklyn broad, Cecile, is really cute and has some screen presence. It is a shame that this film is the only one to bare her name. Kate McNeil achieved slightly more success than Seidel, and she too was good in \"Beach House\".<br /><br />As a film, \"Beach House\" is just excess.

You know, there are these actors and actresses who, once they appear on screen, they manage to control everything and have everyone focus on them and only them, and Crawford is one example of such people. Now I don't mean this in a bad way. In fact, it's rather admirable that one can have so much charisma as to be the center of attention all the time, but one side effect to this is that the people around such characters often don't get the attention that they deserve. <br /><br />This happened to me with QUEEN BEE. It was a Crawford movie, indeed, but it was also an ensemble cast- the characters, Eva, Avery, Judd, Jen, and Carol were all part of one story. But strangely enough, I can only remember Joan Crawford after the end. I should tell you that this Crawford's presence in this movie is very strong, but perhaps that is not even news for all those who have seen GRAND HOTEL, in which she had the same strong presence even alongside Greta Garbo, who is known to have such centralizing effects herself. <br /><br />It is true however, that Crawford is the focus of the story. The movie centers around her character: everything happens because of her and everything doesn't happen because of her. I can't say that I understood Eva completely, but I did try to sympathize with her and I do. She was a \"bitch,\" yes, but not wholly. After all, she wanted her husband's love like any other normal woman. She just wanted to be loved, didn't like being lonely, and went to great measures to get what she wanted but as we all know, it doesn't quite work out as we had planned, and that's the story of Eva Philipps, the Queen Bee.<br /><br />This film is tense, with all of the characters engaged in nervousness, bitterness and hate.

{"id": 39419, "text": "THE BEAST MUST DIE begins with some of the worst music for this film as you can image (other than Polka music). This twangy techno-70s music is just terrible and seems all wrong for a werewolf film. And, once the film gets starts, the sound track continues to blare--with music way too loud and invasive for the film. Rarely do I ever complain so much about a soundtrack, but it just hits you like a brick when the film begins.<br /><br />The film begins with an exciting chase scene--so exciting that you can perhaps ignore the dopey music. It is reminiscent to the film THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME, as a man is being tracked by hunters. However, the hunting ground is very high tech--with motion detectors and microphones everywhere. It turns out that this weird setup was created by a rich guy so that he can invite a group of people there in order to determine which of them is a werewolf!! How, exactly, you'll have to wait to see.<br /><br />The rest of the film plays a bit like \"Ten Little Indians\" (also made into the movie AND THE THERE WERE NONE). In other words, it's a bit of a waiting game until ultimately the true werewolf reveals itself. However, despite an interesting story idea, it's undone by a few dumb touches. For example, just when the rich guy is about to kill the wolf, his wife inexplicably stops him from shooting it--even though this wolf is tearing apart their doggy. The other dumb thing is that although this guy is supposed to be such an amazing hunter, he keeps missing--even at point blank range. He's not the only one--two others do the same thing. These moments are just plain sloppy and do so much to undo the good of the film. Plus, with all the rich guy's money, why doesn't he just lock everyone into cages and see exactly who is the werewolf?! The only big plus is the very ending--it's pretty cool.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I hate films where characters must act stupidly to make the film work. It's a sign of lousy writing--and this film manages to take a very good idea and ruin it. It is watchable, but just barely.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 8949, "text": "\"Mulberry Street\" is basically just another forgettable and mediocre creature-feature flick, but I'm rewarding it with at least two extra points because director Jim Mickle and his enthusiast cast & crew clearly went through several harsh ordeals before they could finish their ambitious project. Mickle came to introduce his film at the Belgian Horror & Fantasy Festival and explained how they had to shoot essential footage in the middle of the crowded streets of Manhattan without any official permission to film there, and how all the actors in this film are friends or in some way related to the director, so none of them received any payments. Bearing all this in mind, plus the fact that \"Mulberry Street\" actually shows the courage and ambition to be a different and largely atmosphere-driven new horror film, I'd say it at least deserves the respect and appreciation of avid horror fanatics and amateur filmmakers all over the world. And the film itself really isn't that bad, neither. A handful of likable characters, all recently evicted tenants of a ramshackle apartment building in Mulberry Str; Manhattan, join together in order to survive a deadly virus that broke out in the city overnight. As a result of constant urban decay, pollution and unbearable heat, the sewer rats of Manhattan are quickly spreading a horrible disease that causes its victims to mutate into a ravenous and bloodthirsty rat-creatures. Once bitten, people rapidly turn into a zombies with the appearance and eating habits of rats, and they only look at their former friends and neighbors as rich sources of food. Clutch, a retired boxer, nervously awaits the homecoming of his soldier daughter, but first he has to protect the other tenants as the rat-zombies are quickly infesting the entire neighborhood. The engaging depiction of the inhabitants of 51, Mulberry Street unquestionably is the biggest advantage of this film. The characters admirably aren't empty-headed junkies or filthy scum, but a close community of hard working and respectable people that are prepared to sacrifice themselves in order to save the others. This is honestly the only film I remember portraying the typical New Yorkers as unsung heroes. Even though the script reveals very few details regarding the lethal rat-virus, the chaotic situation in downtown Manhattan is eerily plausible and the overall atmosphere of \"Mulberry Street\" is tremendously menacing. Jim Mickle and writer/lead star Nick Damici simultaneously grab the opportunity to process a whole cargo-load of social and political criticism into the screenplay, particularly emphasizing the the war in Iraq and the problematic housing accommodation in big cities. Despite of budgetary restrictions, \"Mulberry Street\" also features a satisfying amount of blood and gruesome images. The make-up effects on the victims of the rat-virus are quite nasty and the zombie-attacks are uncompromising. Unfortunately the pacing slows down a bit during the second half of the film and the dialogs begin to sound repetitive. But by then, personally, I was already too impressed to allow the minor & understandable flaws to spoil my viewing experience. I really liked this film, as it has real characters and displays a righteously unhappy world-perspective. I doubt \"Mulberry Street\" will become a film that is easily available, so if you have the opportunity to watch it some time, do not hesitate.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 24090, "text": "I wonder if this would be identifiable as a Hitchcock movie if it weren't identified as such. Maybe. It as a few innovative touches anyway although it's often a little primitive.<br /><br />For one thing it's a theme -- a serial murderer in a comfortably bourgeois setting -- that Hitchcock would return to from time to time. \"Frenzy,\" for instance, and \"Shadow of a Doubt.\" But this isn't really typical in that the later Hitchcock would have complicated the story, or juiced it up, by having the innocent eponymous \"lodger\" guilty of something or other -- maybe just having a closet full of ladies' garments. As it is, he's made Ivor Novello a bit odd looking, given him effete gestures, more makeup than the other men, suggesting that he's gay. Other characters refer to him as \"queer\" (in the old-fashioned sense of quirky) and say of him that \"he's not keen on the ladies.\" (Ivor Novello was himself gay.) <br /><br />There's also a scene in which a sexy young girl is happily taking a bath while the lodger tries to sneak into the bathroom. Shades of \"Psycho.\"<br /><br />And when the lodger is pacing back and forth in his upstairs room, the family look up at the ceiling at the jiggling chandelier and the ceiling becomes transparent so we can see the shoes of the suspect. Oh, it's not \"elegant,\" but it IS \"original.\" Hitchcock was trying something new even then.<br /><br />Then too, there is a scene in a kind of -- boutique? Is that the right word? A fancy dress shop where the heroin models. The prissy looking lodger is seated between two dolls in cloche hats -- I'm afraid I'm guessing again -- and one of them puts an unlit cigarette in her mouth, waiting for the smooth gentleman to light it for her, and maybe buy her that smashing dress too. But the lodger has noticed that -- well, to be frank -- the woman's bare KNEE is on display, the flapper! So, get this, staring straight ahead, he takes out his lighter, flicks it lit, and moves it to the side so she can reach it. Then he disengages himself, stands up, and walks off, to her irritation. It was not necessary to do the scene in that particular fashion but it's the kind of thing Hitchcock would dream up, a small but telling detail. <br /><br />Hitchcock makes his cameo in the crowd of people trying to clobber the lodger, who is hung up on a fence by his handcuffs. (Christian symbolism? I doubt it.) Hitchcock's presence is clear enough in still shots but the print I saw was so old and scratchy half the scene was obscured. <br /><br />Why didn't Hitchcock make an outright movie about Jack the Ripper instead of this one, with an innocent \"Avenger.\" We never find out who or what the real murderer is avenging. Come to think of it, we never even see him. Maybe Hitch wasn't too fond of period pictures. The few that he made were anything but hits. Hitch making a movie set in 1885? What's next? Hitch remaking the shootout at the OK Corral? Hitch doing a biography of Moses? Nah. He had a pretty good sense of his talents and their limitations. When he misjudged them it was usually in the matter of technique, not subject. <br /><br />Worth seeing. In fact, an interesting story.", "sentiment": 0}

She wrote back her favorites were the comedies she made with Cary Grant, MY FAVORITE WIFE & THE AWFUL TRUTH. And that's the singing Irene I like the best AWFUL TRUTH (SHOW BOAT, is a close second! Then ROBERTA and JOY OF LIVING.) And speaking of the awful truth, I don't like STINGEREE. I saw it once because of the director, lead actors and wonderful character actors (still I think the best part of this turkey.) The second time was to give it a second chance, and TCM did run a better print, but the story, script and acting don't mix. It's like a salad dressing that continues to separate, oil on top (that's the opera) and vinegar (that's the western) at the bottom of it all. SPOILERS: Richard Dix plays the title-role, of a highwayman and bandit in 1870's Australia, in this strange mix of swashbuckler and musical. Irene Dunne is Hilda Bouverie, an impoverished serving girl who wants to sing. Left orphaned and homeless by the deaths of her parents, Hilda is now a servant in the home of the Clarksons, the wealthiest family in the province. Hilda is glad to have a roof over her head and three meals a day, but won't really be happy unless she gets a chance to sing, and she has the voice to match her aspirations. Mr. Clarkson (Henry Stephenson) is kind and encouraging enough to her, but his wife (Mary Boland) is a noisy, irritating, no-talent singer who treats Hilda and her other maid Annie (Una O'Connor) as little better than slaves; and Mrs. Clarkson is especially jealous of Hilda, as she also aspires to a singing career, and is eagerly awaiting a visit by London-based composer and impresario Sir Julian Kent (Conway Tearle). And then in rides Stingaree (Richard Dix), a highwayman new to the province, who is already a legend elsewhere in Australia. The authorities, led by the boorish Inspector Radford (George Barraud), know he is there and are set to catch him, but he's smarter than they are and faster on his feet, and outwits them. Stingaree kidnaps Sir Julian and, learning of the Clarksons and their wealth, plans to rob them masquerading as Sir Julian. But when he chances to hear Hilda singing, and gets to meet her, he abandons his plan and, instead, decides to help her  his ruse is uncovered, however, and he is forced to flee, and takes the unwilling girl with him. Together in his lair in the forest, Hilda discovers that Stingaree truly does love/lust after her  he is a man who takes whatever he wants and wants everything, but, as he tells her, \"You are as safe here as you wish to be.\" Stingaree arranges a daring raid on the Clarkson home that allows Hilda's singing to be heard by Sir Julian  the impresario offers her the chance to go to London, and at a career as an opera singer. She's reluctant to accept because Stingaree has been captured, but the highwayman insists that she do it, telling her that he happily gave up his freedom to give Hilda hers. And she conquers the operatic stages of Europe, in a career that takes her to Berlin, the Paris Opera, La Scala, and London's Covent Garden, and leading roles in Trovatore, Martha, and the rest of the major operatic repertory of the period. But she can't forget the sacrifice that Stingaree made for her, or the love they share for each other, and decides that even if it means giving up everything, she must return to Australia to find him.

But, in 1926, movie-makers were still struggling to discover the basics, whereas in 1959 cinema was a relatively mature medium, and 1959 version could look back on two prior productions (not counting The Circular Staircase, 1915 and 1956). One infers that the 1959 version was made in haste, with a low budget, and perhaps with a lack of concern.<br /><br />The screenplay itself is pedestrian. At one or more point, each of the characters does something unnatural because Wilbur (who wrote the screenplay and directed the film) did not find a way to advance the story naturally.<br /><br />The sets, lighting, camera angles, and music give this movie the feel of a television production of that same era. For example, when there is meaningful use of shadow, it is only to produce simple silhouettes. (I don't know how the actual television production, from a little less than a year later, compares to this movie.)<br /><br />This film has apparently been allowed to slip into the public domain.

C. Fields in all of his pompous, vulgar glory: evasive, duplicitous, sneaky - utterly wonderful. Delivering dialogue in his unique buzz saw rasp, he gives out so many familiar lines that at times he almost seems to be performing a self-parody. This film brilliantly shows why Fields needed the sound cinema to let him be fully appreciated, and with Paramount giving him free rein to develop his material as he wished, it is not surprising that the film is a classic. Fans need look no further to find the essential Fields.<br /><br />The romance between Judith Allen & Joe Morrison is a rather dull affair, although the young man sings well. Tammany Young plays Fields' loyal amanuensis. Movie mavens will recognize comedian Billy Bletcher as the tomato thrower & sour-visaged sheriff Clarence Wilson, both uncredited. Legend has it that Hollywood's first movie star, Florence Lawrence, derelict & forgotten, made one of her last unbilled appearances here before her 1938 suicide.<br /><br />Fields found it useful to populate his films with at least one she-dragon, a female of frightful aspect against whom he could bounce off some of his best humor. This film has two: rail-thin, Nora Cecil - prim & dour as the troupe's suspicious landlady; and most especially silly Jan Duggan, horridly bejeweled & curled, as Field's wealthy target. Here was an actress, now nearly forgotten, who could easily equal in hilarity even Fields himself. It is generally overlooked how important her contribution is to the celebrated supper table scene with Fields & Baby LeRoy - one of the funniest sequences ever to appear in an American film. And her rendition of `Gathering Up The Shells On The Seashore' is a wonderful spoof of such sentimental songs as `When You And I Were Young, Maggie,' which were so popular in that era. Miss Duggan would return to briefly plague Fields in three additional films, including THE BANK DICK (1940). (She died in 1977 at the age of 95.)<br /><br />Fields has included the old melodrama The Drunkard into the plot and to his credit he plays it straight,' letting its honest antique sentiment speak for itself. In his own private olio, Fields makes a curtain call to show off his astonishing talent of legerdemain. It is wonderful to have his routine captured on film as he really is quite amazing - it is easy to see how at one time he was considered the world's greatest juggler.

The amount of praise I heard for \"Popular\" made me check it out.<br /><br />The advertisements were wrong.<br /><br />What I found in this show was a sleek, hilarious, dramatic, clever, filled to the brim with 80's references show not about kids in High School today (circa 1999-2000), but if kids from my generation were to go to High School today (yes, I went to High School in the 80's).<br /><br />I think the failure of \"Popular\" was the advertising I referred to earlier for the show...it was going after kids in high school for ratings.

What we have here is a cross between The Shining (1980) with it's hotel style setting & The Amityville Horror (1979) with the now standard haunted house scenario (spooky property has a dark past, you know the sort of thing) along with a few boring mystery elements thrown in there for good measure. The film spends far too much time showing annoying American teens wondering around this old hotel in the dark, it just doesn't make for particularly entertaining viewing & gets very boring very quickly. The script is predictable & is nothing more than a teen slasher with some tenuous supernatural elements along with an obligatory twist ending which didn't do much for me at all to be honest as I thought it was pretty ineffectual. There is one amazing scene I just couldn't work out, in it one of the annoying American high school teens examines a twenty year old blood stain & determines that whoever left the stain was trying to hide something! How on Earth do you work that out? Also it turns out that whatever the victim was trying to hide they hid inside an nearby air vent so when they were killed how could they have been trying to hide something when they had clearly already hidden it? Also why didn't the police find that severed hand in the vent only a few feet away? According to earlier exposition the police had 'torn the place apart' looking for clues so why not find that severed hand only a few feet away from a murder victim? The police obviously didn't do a very good job, did they? There's no explanation as to how or why there's a ghost in the hotel or how it manages to alter reality or how it can transport people back in time &, of course, the annoying American teens mobile phones don't work for no apparent reason either so they get isolated from the outside world in a now obligatory plot device for low budget horror films. The story doesn't engage or entertain, that character's are both poor & annoying, the plot is forgettable & not that much actually happens.<br /><br />The hotel sets or locations (not sure if they filmed in a real hotel or in a studio) are quite nice but why are some of the lights on? Wouldn't the electricity have been turned off? Horror wise there's not much to get excited about here, there's a few bloody corpses & what looks like a bamboo stick stuck through someone but not much else & there's not much in the way of scares since the less than impressive CGI computer effects have the opposite effect & make things almost laughable. There are one or two bits with a decent atmosphere but it's never sustained for any period of time. The film seems to take itself very seriously & there's no humour or fun to be seen anywhere which doesn't help when the plot feels so stale & lethargic. To give it some credit there are a few period flashbacks at the end which are quite nicely done I suppose.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $2,000,000 this has better production values than a lot of recent low budget horror but that's hardly any sort of recommendation on it's own. Filmed in Los Angeles. The only real cast member of note is cult German born actor Udo Kier who doesn't look interested at all & to my eyes seems to put on more weight in every subsequent film he makes (the Steven Seagal of the low budget horror world!).<br /><br />Pray for Morning is a dull supernatural teen horror slasher that doesn't satisfy on any level really, never mind pray for morning I would suggest that most audiences will be praying for it to finish not too long after it has started.", "sentiment": 0}

The characters felt so real to me, it seemed like I was sitting at the bar, watching the various interactions of the people there. I kept waiting to see if Rick would turn out to be a total jerk, but it became clear that he was just a rather shallow, unemotional type guy ,who clearly was not interested in relationships and commitment. He never once said anything to lead poor, hapless Debbie on, with the possible exception of his vague, noncommittal response to her dinner invitation. Even at the end, when she was literally clinging to him in the bar, he didn't say anything mean or abusive, but told her, in a low key, not uncompassionate way, that she needed to go home and sober up. It wasn't what she wanted to hear, but it actually was the kindest thing he could have said to her, under the circumstances.<br /><br />Gena Rowlands' performance as Debbie's mother was heartbreaking in its perfect blend of strength and fragility. Her reaction to Nicky's death, and her meeting with his son at the funeral were incredibly moving. Again, I felt the reality of the characters and their lives in a way one doesn't encounter often in movies.<br /><br />Uma Thurman's performance was so dead on, that I actually felt embarrassed for her in her desperate, drunken scene in the bar. Debbie would be a pain to put up with, in real life, but her frequently obnoxious mannerisms and attitudes never outweighed the pity I felt for her, as someone who had been badly wounded at a young age, and had real issues as the result. It's a daring performance, in which she doesn't hold back on honestly depicting the painful vulnerability of her character. I found myself wishing at the end that she would find a nice guy who would really appreciate her, and that all three women would have happier lives in the future. There's something about this movie that gets hold of you and doesn't let go; maybe because a lot of us have felt like Debbie at one point or another in our lives.", "sentiment": 0}

While watching I thought Keri amazingly sexy and wondered if she was some Playboy Centerfold who won a part in a small movie. (check out her biography on IMDb, she WAS a bunny at one time). Every outfit she had was absolutely cute and hot looking. The cars were cool and it was fun watching them race. Two bloopers I caught were when Skank and Gutterhead had a shotgun. They kept talking about putting \"bullets\" in the shotgun. You would think scriptwriters knew that you put shotgun SHELLS in a shotgun, not bullets. Bullets go in a gun. Also, I had to look up Cassavetes birthplace. For 99% of the movie he speaks \"standard American English\" (no identifiable accent). But one scene where he is in his bad guy garage, and Randy Quaid approaches him, he slips into some kind of New York/New Jersey accent. See if you can catch it, it's only a few lines but he gives away his birthplace. I looked him up on the IMDb and he's from New York. Randy Quaid is perfectly cast, as usual.

{"id": 14594, "text": "A taut and topical political thriller that, unfortunately, goes off the rails.<br /><br />In its defense, the basic premise is plausible, the writing is tense and dramatic, and the acting and direction are professional. Other posters have complained about implausibilities in the plot, and the wrong names used for things. A political thriller must have some unexpected twists or there would be no story, and we can assume that the \"H2O\" world has different names for things like the RCMP and War Measures Act.<br /><br />The series, however, goes off the rails in the third hour. We can accept one or two extremely implausible events if the story requires it, but when near-impossible events happen again and again, with a new one each few minutes, credibility crumbles. Worse, earlier crises are left unresolved before the next one hits.<br /><br />I'll give an example. An assassin is killing anyone, no matter how powerful or insignificant, who threatens the conspiracy. One of the major characters is a police detective who is about to unravel the plot. The assassin traps her, spills clues about the conspiracy, and then lets her go. This is an absurd Hollywoodism, like something from an old Flash Gordon serial. There are even bigger howlers in the series, and I know what happens later, but this is the one that made me want to throw something at the TV.<br /><br />The series plays like it was written by a committee, and each member wanted to get their plot twist in whether it made sense or not. The ending is a disappointment too; there is yet another plot twist in the last few minutes and the story just stops.

We've all been guilty of it at some time or another, but my excuse for watching things like \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" and \"Silver Spoons\" is this: I was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile.<br /><br />Thankfully, I now appreciate the good stuff. Stargate SG-1 is not good. The 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it, every line of stilted dialogue, every bit of needless technobabble. The writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss Star Trek: Voyager. If your show makes me long for the worst Trek show ever, you're in trouble.<br /><br />The film Stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by James Spader and Kurt Russell, full of fascinating Egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool sci-fi ideas. With the exception of a little of the original music, none of what made the film fun appears in this show. Even Richard Dean Anderson, who made MacGyver watchable and Legend interesting, seems like he's half asleep most episodes.<br /><br />The budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement. The cinematography isn't much better, as vanilla and dull as the scripts.

Well, basically I was still in grade school and didn't care for anything that wasn't loaded with action or comedy. I gave this movie another try when it came on Cinemax and recorded it on tape. It's a very impressive film that's both suspenseful and romantic, without being over-the-top. The only thing that really bugged me was the soundtrack. My cousins upstairs bought the soundtrack and would listen to it constantly, so I'm pretty much tired of hearing every single one of those songs. <br /><br />Kevin Costner gives an engaging, charismatic performance. Whitney Houston is not a terrific actress, but she can pull of a dramatic line without making me burst into laughter. So I gotta give her a little bit of credit, being that this was her first performance. I've seen much worse. And it's nice to see Whitney looking very pretty, as opposed to now where she's destroying herself with drugs. And though the relationship was between a white man and a black woman, the film didn't get preachy about it. <br /><br />I just think Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote the script) should've just made Whitney's character a singer, since we never see her act in this film. We never see clips of her films. All we see her do is sing. So why not make her a singer and have the climax at the Grammy Awards? Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film. It works well as both a love story and a thriller. And unlike most romantic films, the two characters don't constantly jump into bed together and the sex is left to the imagination.

{"id": 13084, "text": "Having seen Donald Margulies' play when it opened in New York, I was interested in what Norman Jewison, the director, had done with it for the screen version. It helps that Mr. Margulies did his own adaptation, although, it appears to this viewer, the stage version was more satisfying. Not that there's anything wrong with the film, it's just that the cast in the play was far superior than these well intentioned actors we see in the movie. Mr. Margulies has tried to open his play, but it just doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />The basic premise, and a caveat to good friends, is to stay away from \"fixing up\" prospective marriage partners, as things in life are a bit more complicated than a good ending in a book, a play, a movie, or human relations. <br /><br />Karen and Gabe are happily married. They conjure to arrange a meeting with Beth, a painter, and Tom, a lawyer. Basically, the idea of having mutual friends meet one another, might not be bad, but in reality things should be let alone and let nature takes its course. The bright idea back fires on Karen, who, upon hearing at the beginning of the film that her best friend, Beth, is divorcing Tom, is visibly upset. She feels betrayed by these two people she was instrumental in bringing together.<br /><br />It's hard for both, Gabe and Karen, to think where they went wrong in their match making roles. They never take into consideration that Beth is totally wrong for Tom, and vice versa. The problem is that this couple don't think that Beth and Tom have found new partners in what appears to be a much solid relationships than what they had together. Karen and Gabe are crushed, but in reality, not everything is perfect in their own marriage. We get hints that yes, they are not completely happy, but they have decided to stay in the marriage out of decency and out of duty to their two boys, which is what Beth and Tom have failed to do. Call them old fashioned, but one has to give Karen and Gabe a lot of credit for at least trying to stay together as a family.<br /><br />Andie MacDowell is Karen; she is a beautiful woman. In the movie, Ms. MacDowell appears a bit distant. She loved to bring people together and resents their friends separation. Ms. MacDowell's Karen comes across as a hard and judgmental person. Dennis Quaid tries hard to give Gabe warmth. Perhaps he comes across as the best of the four principals. Toni Collette's Beth is an enigma until her confrontation with Karen at the restaurant, then, we see a woman that is not shy in telling her best friend off as she embarks in a new relationship. Greg Kinnear is Tom. He is perhaps the weakest link in the quartet, as he is perhaps, not treated fairly by Karen, or Gabe.<br /><br />The movie remains a bit theatrical, but Norman Jewison has done wonders with the material.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 14906, "text": "I agree with the critics who lambasted 'Beyond Borders', a film with the intellectual depth of an infomercial that portrays starving children to elicit donations. Similarly, the filmmakers' methods undermine their intentions, if their intentions were in fact as noble as many of the other reviewers here seem to think. If they sought to inspire viewer sympathy and support, the filmmakers succeeded. Personally, I feel for the extras exploited in the film, and I support any viewer who stopped watching within the first hour.<br /><br />If this were merely Angelina Jolie's latest bit of entertaining fluff, I could forgive the film for its shortcomings as a star vehicle designed to exhibit the actress' ample charms. Here, however, Jolie is cast in a serious role as a UN relief worker whose only contributions to the relief effort appear to be her wealth, her compassion, and her ability to strike a pose during a bad situation. I could almost hear Isaac Misrahi cooing at Jolie's miraculously kempt appearance and missionary-chic ensembles. Are we meant to applaud Sarah (Jolie) for not wearing perfume after Nick's ridicule, even when we can see faint traces of mascara on her drooping eyelids as she broods in Chechnya? The attention to Sarah's impeccable appearance detracts from a film that seemingly condemns such superficial concerns in light of human suffering throughout the world. Moreover, it contributes to the overall hypocrisy of a movie meant to galvanize social reflection and reaction through the didactic speeches of its belligerent protagonist Nick (Clive Owen), while exhibiting remarkable indifference to the objectification of the nameless victims that suffer and die in the film so that our love is not for them, but for the named heroes who suffer and die out of pity.<br /><br />In 'Beyond Borders', the world is a simple place in which the problems of Chechnya, Cambodia, and Ethiopia are conflated to represent Third World issues for which compassion is the panacea. Perhaps if this were true, I could appreciate Sarah's sudden ill-conceived trip to Ethiopia at the beginning of the movie, thus precipitating her future involvement with the UN. Why not admire her for responding to Nick's impassioned plea for more funding at a dinner in London when her peers are cruel and apathetic? For starters, the fact that she is so moved by one incident is more indicative of her obliviousness before the pivotal event than any admirable quality attributed to her reactionary social conscience. Amidst her tears, Nick's speech, and the audience's jeers, a little boy is humiliated to make a point. Worse, a fracas ensues, and his separation from Nick leads to the boy's demise. Sarah's journey to Ethiopia is as senseless as his death, but 'Beyond Borders' seemingly justifies these events by implying that irrationality is at the heart of all worthwhile endeavors. Nick, after all, is as irrational as Sarah. In his recklessness and outrage at the human suffering he encounters as a Third World doctor, Nick is an ineffective negotiator and fundraiser. He is subsequently forced to resort to an uneasy alliance with an insipid trafficker in weaponry and other questionable goods. His actions lead to plot complications involving the relief workers, but the social consequences for the local populations they endeavor to help remain unexplored. Even when Nick later expresses his guilt over the little boy's death, I wonder if we are meant to feel sorry for him or the boy.<br /><br />Nick is the cynical foil for Sarah's naïve idealist, but, predictably, the initial hostility between them turns to attraction. It's inevitable, I suppose, that the two beautiful do-gooders exchange a few clichéd remarks about the state of the world before tumbling into bed. First, however, they share meaningful glances during Sarah's short stay in Ethiopia. The shipment of provisions she brings with her lasts only a few days, and as her only occupation involves feeding milk to an extremely malnourished boy whom she rescued from certain death, she leaves. Her bedside vigil earns her the respect of the relief workers, but the film does not question the outcome of her actions. It becomes apparent that Sarah's act, along with her mediocre piano playing, is supposed to endear her to Nick. Never mind that her efforts are short-lived and that she abandons the now motherless child to suffer the cruelties of a prolonged existence alone.<br /><br />What more can we expect from a film that suggests food shortages are the root of famine, evil is the cause of war, and apathy is the sole impediment to social change? If only things were so simple. One of the many problems facing relief efforts is that policymakers are unwilling to explore and fund long-term solutions that have enduring consequences but less immediate results, and thus this film, in its glorification of thoughtless emotion and quick solutions, actually hinders such efforts. Moreover, its neocolonial view of the locals in Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Chechnya as savage criminals or helpless victims is derogatory and condescending. These are not people, but stereotypes ripped from the headlines of sensationalist magazines.<br /><br />This film contends that Sarah, in her facile understanding of the situations she encounters, can somehow rescue the world from its own depravity by accompanying trucks carrying needed supplies across ravaged terrain. What ethnocentric, ignorant conceit to think that she could provide aid without adequate knowledge of the local languages, people, or customs! Then again, all Third World countries are the same in their shared devastation, and Sarah cares, right? Good intentions are no excuse for inexcusable actions or bad film-making. Why doesn't Sarah combat poverty in London or address the needs of her family, which she abandons to endanger her life in reckless pursuit of Nick? The answer's obvious: Then there would be no tragic soap opera against an exotic backdrop of human suffering. It is unfortunate that Sarah and Nick need the exploitation of others to add meaning to their bland love story.", "sentiment": 0}

However, I can't say I could relate to the dark world that is portrayed in Ghost World. I have read the comic book after watching the movie. Both of the versions of \"Ghost World\" portray a world full of sad and annoying people, pedophiles, typical idiotic high school students, and most of all, people faking individuality. <br /><br />I don't think \"Ghost World\" is meant to be realistic, but it's meant to portray this world that we live in. Enid and her friend are the main characters who think they are above everyone else, including the depressed guy that is Seymour. However, things don't turn out as they planned. I thought Enid and her friend were very realistic characters. They aren't shown as heroines who are greater than everyone else because of how different they are and how they don't let themselves controlled by society. On the contrary. This is a good point for the movie, since the realism isn't too overwhelming. However, the depressing atmosphere of the movie can be if you aren't into this. As the movie keeps going, it gets more and more depressing and the ending just leaves you with a \"bitter taste in your mouth\". <br /><br />It's not that \"Ghost World\" didn't move me.

Gervaise is such an 'English' comic whilst Guest's sensibilities are very American - but in the shared fascination with human idiosyncracies, banalities and foibles, they both create a very contemporary form of the comedy of manners.", "sentiment": 0}

The film follows young Stiles as he confronts a perplexing supernatural mystery that engulfs his grandfather's sprawling estate. The film has a very crisp, polished look to it, thanks to an excellent to-video transfer. The acting is for the most part excellent, particularly in the case of Jan Rubes, who plays Benjamin's grandfather. The story is constructed and executed effectively, right up until the end, where the film's greatest weakness lies. The manner and speed with which the mystery is solved will undoubtedly leave many viewers disappointed. It left this reviewer thinking the writer, having developed a truly interesting web of mystery, was at a loss in finding an effective way to have it solved, and finally settled on a climax which reeks of rushed carelessness. Too bad, as the rest of this film is a lot of fun, and is suitable for family viewing. Also, young viewers are less likely to feel cheated by the ending. There are no scenes of shocking violence (or foul language), in this picture. In all, an above average and at times truly spooky film, suitable for the entire family.

It isn't too long after, however, that the Russians announce that they too have built a similar computer for those same purposes on their side--Guardian. And when the two machines begin sharing information at a speed nobody can believe, an attempt is made to disable them.<br /><br />This unfortunately just raises the machines' ire; and in retaliation, they launch their weapons at each other's home nations. The result is a chilling scenario that is potentially becoming all too real these days.<br /><br />COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT was not a big hit at the box office for various reasons. One is that its cast wasn't exactly well known. Another reason is that its ending isn't exactly a happy one. Still a third reason is that Universal had trouble trying to promote it in the wake of the huge success of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The latter reason is obvious: Colossus and Guardian, like HAL in the Kubrick movie, become central characters here. The difference here is that while HAL malfunctions due to a programming conflict, Colossus and Guardian remain all too stable, convinced beyond a doubt that they know how to protect Mankind better than Man himself. As the computers point out: \"One inevitable rule is that Mankind is his own worst enemy.\"<br /><br />Joseph Sargent's direction is efficient, and the special effects work of Albert Whitlock still manages to work despite its obvious age.

For that matter, it's not quite as deep or well-written as the somewhat similar \"A Question of Love\"--a TV drama starring Gena Rowlands and Jane Alexander on the subject of a lesbian couple fighting to keep custody of their kids. But it's still a great little movie. Unlike the other film, this one shares more of the relationship between the two women. Valerie Bertinelli is surprisingly good as a woman who falls in love with another woman, for the first time, and doesn't have the usual stereotypical reaction to it--freaking out.

In their deliberate and manifest fragmentation, they immediately seem to offer a schizophrenic view of society and the lives depicted within it. Yet to interpret these films as such and only that would be to misunderstand the overall logic of these films. In their very diversity, they seem to offer an overall 'world view', whether it be clear-cut or oblique, in which the characters in these films are all part of the same condition.<br /><br />Whether damning (as in \"Happiness\") or redemptive (as in \"Magnolia\"), their world view is ever-present. It is with \"Wonderland\" that we have a film which plays with this tension, I think, more skillfully than the aforementioned films. The film is primarily about the lives of three sisters (and their friends, partners, family, etc.) living in London, who are all disparate in terms of their personalities and lifestyles. Winterbottom's message, intimated by the title, is to show that they are all 'Alices in Wonderland'. It is about coming to terms with this predicament and expressing their emotions about it, that the films ably deals with.<br /><br />Shooting his film on location with a shaky hand-held camera in brutally realist hues, Winterbottom reveals a London full of life - a background sharply contrasted by the three women pushed against it, highlighting their increasing loneliness and alienation, whether they accept it or not. Like \"Magnolia\", the first half of the film traces their predicament (each in powerfully unique ways) as it slowly reaches towards a discernible 'crisis point' in which these sisters are forced to accept fate.<br /><br />Not wanting to laud the film too much on the basis of these humanist ideals, one must understand it with the notion of humanism in mind as this is the level at which it works best. Unlike \"Happiness\" in which Solondz wallows in the depravity of social misfits, Winterbottom valiantly offers a redemptive glimpse of humankind, in which despite all adversity, there is still hope yet.", "sentiment": 0}

Davis plays Linda Gilman, a no-nonsense editor of a Home and Life type magazine in New York. Robert Montgomery is Carey Jackson, her new writer and former lover. Three years ago the two were almost ready to get married when he got cold feet and walked out on her. Through zany mishaps he ends up working for her three years later, and the two have not lost their attraction to one another. Linda packs up her staff for Indiana to do a cover story for their June issue, covering a wedding in small-town Midwest, U.S.A. Once there, they have to completely transform the house and the people in it, because they do not meet the cosmopolitan standards of these New Yorkers. Along the way, Carey decides to mix things up a bit when he discovers that the bride is marrying the brother of her ex-fiancée, and her sister is actually in love with the groom-to-be. (Get all that?) Complicating things is the fact that Linda and Carey are falling all over each other, rekindling their romance, which is getting in the way of the task at hand.<br /><br />\"June Bride\" is supposed to be a madcap comedy, but it's just a boring mess. As stated before, there are some actors that are good in every film, and Bette Davis is one of those actors. Her performance was excellent, but the film that she was forced to work in was just plain bad, and her persona in the film hints that she knows it. Robert Montgomery, who is all slapstick in the film without a hint of charm, has absolutely no chemistry with Davis, which leads to a very flat film. The story was dumb, and not charming in the least. Really, the only interesting thing about the film is the director's first name. There's actually not a lot more to say about the film, except that it's too bad that \"June Bride\" wasn't better, because it was rare for a couple of reasons: It was one of the few Bette Davis comedies and it was one of the few Bette Davis films I had not yet seen.

In the film, we first see the main characters, as they fight each other for some abstract ideal, something they come to realize (or already realized) that they don't really believe in. During their stay at Dongmakgol, however, they come to realize what is truly worth fighting for, and ultimately trade their lives to preserve it.<br /><br />To me, it seems that the movie yearns for the innocence that Korea lost during the Korean War. Dongmakgol, the village - exemplified by the young, exceedingly naive, and perhaps a bit crazy, but cute, woman - is sort of Korea's Eden. The villagers know nothing of guns, grenades, or even that there's a war going on. When one villager asks one of the soldiers who has attacked Korea, the soldier has trouble getting the villager to understand that it is Korea that has attacked itself. For the villager, it just doesn't compute.<br /><br />There's a somewhat non-so-subtle theme of the hope of reunification (but, definitely a bias toward South Korea), which reminds me of Taegukgi.<br /><br />This is the director Kwang-hyun Park's first film, I believe. For being so young, he is an adept director. I anticipate his next film with hope.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 14100, "text": "Surely, the Joan Crawford in this laughably over-the-top 1953 melodrama must have been Faye Dunaway's direct inspiration for her lacerating impersonation of the screen legend in \"Mommie Dearest\". The garishly Technicolor film marked Crawford's highly trumpeted return to MGM after she was unceremoniously pushed out in the early 1940's only to make a comeback at Warner Brothers in a series of meaty roles in classic films like \"Mildred Pierce\" and \"Humoresque\" and prove she had the chops to handle older roles. It's too bad this is such a silly vehicle because Crawford, hovering around fifty at that point in her career, seems determined to make something substantial out of it. With her hair a flaming orange and her face severely tightened, she plays a disagreeably vainglorious Broadway diva named Jenny Stewart, a musical comedy star that seems to have all of Margo Channing's insecurity but little of her scathing wit. Instead, Crawford is made to snarl the lines in John Michael Hayes and Jan Lustig's limp screenplay without any noticeable irony.<br /><br />Everyone kowtows to Jenny and cowers when she has her frequent outbursts, everyone except Tye Graham, a blind pianist hired to be her accompanist. Of course, they will inevitably fall in love, but this absurdity occurs almost in a vacuum since director Charles Walters seems more interested in showing Jenny as a raging harpy when she isn't acting pitiable in the privacy of her bedroom. For an MGM production, the movie looks surprisingly budget conscious and contains only one fully-costumed production number, the amazingly offensive and badly choreographed \"Two-Faced Woman\" which Crawford and a chorus of dancers perform in blackface (!). It has to be seen to be believed. Crawford's singing voice is dubbed by an emphatic singer named India Adams, not the worst offense at the time since such lip-syncing was pervasive. As a dancer, Crawford likes to show off her still-impressive gams, but her moves are so slow and deliberately minimized that Carol Burnett's years-later parody looks all the more accomplished by comparison.<br /><br />Michael Wilding simply looks embarrassed as Tye, especially in the final wrap-up scene that requires him to have an excessive tantrum, and an extremely disengaged Gig Young is wasted (and looks wasted) as a sycophantic drunk leeching off Jenny. The one scene that works is between Jenny and her beer-guzzling mother, played with unapologetic relish by Marjorie Rambeau. They actually seem related. The 2008 DVD contains several extras - a 14-minute retrospective featurette called \"Tough Baby: Torch Song\", a PSA for the Jimmy Fund featuring Crawford at home with her subservient children, an audio clip of her recording session (apparently done before the decision was made to dub her voice), a vintage MGM cartoon and short, and the original theatrical trailer. It's just not good enough to be considered a camp classic, but there are moments that truly defy logic.", "sentiment": 0}

When Seed came a lot of people was impressed - except the usual Bollbashers - but who cares about them nowadays? Seed was way more cynical than what we've seen from Uwe before, but still had some silliness because the absurd comic book-style killer.<br /><br />But with Tunnel Rats Uwe has abandon every kinda comedy, satire and tongue-in-cheek. Tunnel Rats is dead serious and works very well that way. It's a story about soldiers in the Vietnam-war that are going to clean up the underground tunnels that Viet Cong uses. Of course everything breaks into pure hell...<br /><br />Boll spends some time with the characters first. Let us know them - and let the actors do some impressive and naturalistic performances. It's not a pro-American movie... and not a pro-Vietnamese movie either. It's quite natural and shows the brutality at both forces. For once he injects some personality and motivation to the Viet Congs to, and as good performances as the American actors.<br /><br />It goes into horror-territory (almost) when the tunnels are introduced, but still keeps it realistic. The tunnels are small, because the Vietnamese is small, so it get's extra claustrophobic for the bigger built Americans. Above the ground there's some great action to, well worth a look for those - like me - who loves jungle action. Blood, squibs, limbs blown of, explosions and a nasty feeling of realism. There's no super-soldiers here. People just die.<br /><br />The Bollbashers would celebrate this movie if there was another name as a director, if Boll used an alias. They just hate it because it's Boll directing.<br /><br />I love his popcorn-flicks, but I love even more when he comes in to more darker territories and shows us what the world is about.<br /><br />The ending is dark and cynical, but probably more real than any other Vietnam-movie.

{"id": 46144, "text": "I am a fan of Bela Lugosi but I also realize that he often appeared in cheesy films. However, much of this cheese was actually a lot of fun to watch despite the low budgets and silly writing. Sadly, however, this film is neither well made nor is it cheesy fun--just amazingly dull.<br /><br />The film begins with the old Monogram Studios logo--the one with the monorails and zeppelins. Despite this cool start, I also immediately realized that because it was made by a so-called \"Poverty Row\" studio, that the budget and overall quality would be suspect.<br /><br />Wallace Ford is a rather obnoxious reporter (a standard cliché of the day) who is assigned to Chinatown due to some suspicious murders. At the heart of it all is Mr. Wong--but exactly WHO Wong is no one seems to know. Considering the film stars Lugosi, it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to figure it probably is him!! However, who thought that a Hungarian with a heavy accent would make a good Chinese-American?! And who would have thought that Lugosi actually looked and sounded MORE Chinese than his motley group of henchmen. They all sported Chinese-style clothes but looked about as Chinese as Mae West!! The film does have some killing and tossing of knives and even some bamboo shoots being inserted under the nails. Yet, because the acting is so flat, the script so limp that even these crazy story elements can't breathe life into this soggy biscuit. Perhaps the movie would have been better if Lugosi had actually played twins--then maybe two Wongs could have gotten it right! I should be ashamed of myself.<br /><br />A final note--The DVD version of this film I saw was from Passport Video and was of very dubious quality (it came in \"The Bela Lugosi Box\"). This company specializes in releasing public domain films and consistently does nothing to clean up the prints. This one was almost unwatchable due to terrible sound and no captioning. Also, Passport imprints their logo at the bottom right corner of the screen--which seems like a lot of nerve considering they didn't pay for the film!!

{"id": 15145, "text": "I just happened to catch this for the third or fourth time, and first time with my wife, on Universal HD today. Taylor Hackford does a phenomenal job in this movie. Chuck Berry, one of the most complicated and conflicted figures in the history of rock and pop music is rich territory and Hackford managed to catch Berry in all of his many guises - charming, professional, intelligent, thoughtful, bitter, petulant, unprofessional, difficult, and combative. What really marks this movie as a superior documentary is Hackford refusal to judge Berry to focus on just documenting the man and his behavior in a variety of situations and from a variety of sources. There really is no ax-grinding going on in this movie and there is no whitewashing - everything is what it is whether it's Berry in a touching scene with his mother and father or it's Berry in a petulant rehearsal stare-down with Keith Richards when Berry isn't getting his way.<br /><br />Hackford's other great achievement in this movie is the excellent recording of Berry's 60th Anniversary Concert, the predominate reason for the whole project and the involvement of other pop/rock music notables, at St. Louis' Fox Theatre. Backed by Keith Richards, Johnnie Johnson (Berry's pianist and forgotten early influence), Steve Jordan, Bobby Keys, Robert Cray, and Joey Spaminato, Berry performs what is probably his best show in 30 years. Hackford catches the performer's excitement, the crowd's excitement, and Berry's energy and showmanship in a way those of us too young to have seen or heard Berry can begin to understand why he serves a such a seminal influence in pop and rock music.<br /><br />The movie is full of entertaining nuggets. Hackford's interviews with Keith Richards are fascinating. Richards' comments are just insightful about Berry, the influence of Berry's music, and the influence of Johnson of Berry's songs; they're also fascinating in just watching and listening to Richards himself - part mystic, part philosopher, part drunk. Also particularly interesting is a three-way conversation between Berry, Little Richard, and Bo Diddly who go into great detail about their early careers, music, business, and how racism negatively affected their careers and their recognition as the earliest purveyors of rock and roll.<br /><br />I think this movie is interesting regardless of whether your actually interested in Berry beforehand or not.

And it continued all through the film. After half an hour where we had been shown how miserable this middle-aged lady was and what she was willing to go through to save her grandchild I thought that something was going to happen, that the film would turn around. But it never did. This story could be told in 15 minutes, there is no reason to make it longer than that. You might think that making it as long as it was was to show the depth of the characters and what they went through, but they weren't even close to give this any deeper meaning or emotion. I really think they went too far in describing the misery. For example the behavior of the people in the bank. Nobody in a bank talk to a customer like that, not even close.<br /><br />And at the sex club they play the one song over and over again, and she's so good jerking them off that they stand in lines so long that they would probably had to wait an hour to be jerked off, and that hour had to be spent in between other horny males...come on, this was so exaggerated and stupid that I was embarrassed.<br /><br />I could not recommend this movie.

This is a better film than LOVE CRAZY which they made the following year. This is a truly hilarious film, with a wonderful script and first rate gag lines, with plenty of opportunities for laughing out loud. The story itself is, or at least seems, flimsy and nonsensical. William Powell was hit on the head nine years earlier and has had amnesia. Having previously been a con man, he has along with the amnesia experienced a total personality change. He has settled down and become a respectable citizen of Habsberg, Pennsylvania, where he is a pillar of the community, the head of the Boy Scouts, and a member of the Rotary Club, the Lions Club, and all those worthy bodies. He manages a pottery. He never touches alcohol, his hobby is taxidermy, and he even keeps a stuffed squirrel by his bedside which he stuffed himself. He is also pathologically mean with money and counts every penny obsessively. In other words, he has become a super-bore, and his attractive wife Myrna Loy can't stand being ignored anymore and has filed for divorce from this most disappointing, annoying, and unsexy husband. At this point he is hit on the head again and reverts to being his previous mischievous self, whom Loy had never known. This leads to all sorts of comedic escapades and because he now finds Myrna Loy irresistible, Powell sets about wooing her afresh as his new/old self (hence the title of the film). The strange thing is that there are documented cases in the annals of psychology of this sort of amnesia-associated personality change taking place, and also of the reverting back. It is rare and extreme condition, but it does happen. It is known as a dissociated fugue-state. (See my review of HOME AT SEVEN with Ralph Richardson where I discuss this psychological issue further.) The general public will just accept all this as 'a bit of hokum', not being aware that such things have actually happened from time to time. However, this is no time to be serious. This film is intended as pure fun. It works because of the magical sparkle between Powell and Loy, which chiefly owes its magic to Powell's remarkable and humorous personality and the unique response to it which seems to have emerged spontaneously from Myrna Loy from the moment they met. Theirs was a cinematic matching made in heaven. The two of them together really are so amazing that one ceases to pay any attention to what the film is about, and one just watches, mesmerized, as they interact with one another. They could be sitting and knitting or reciting the telephone book and it would barely matter. In this film, Myrna Loy finds 'the man she always thought was hidden inside' her husband and 'loves him again'. However, he then is hit on the head again. And I won't ruin anything by saying what happens next. One of my little hobbies is imitating the cooing of doves. I had not realized that William Powell was there before me, but then I must not reveal too much about what he is cooing about, as it might not make it past the Hays Office.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 46595, "text": "Anybody who thought the original \"Deathstalker\" (1983) was abysmal should skip its lightweight, lackluster sequel \"Deathstalker: Duel of the Titans\" with John Terlesky taking over the sword wielding duties from Rick Hill as the eponymous warrior hero. Indeed, \"Deathstalker 2\" looks like a threadbare straight-to-video sequel. This potboiler relies, much to \"Big Bad Mama\" director Jim Wynorski's chagrin, on footage from its superior predecessor as well as generic Roger Corman footage. Furthermore, neither scenarist Neil Ruttenberg nor dialogue writer R.J. Robertson makes any mention of Deathstalker's previous heroic exploits. <br /><br />Wynorski states on the commentary track that they tore up the first screenplay and reworked it because it was so terrible. \"Deathstalker 2\" is pretty terrible as it is, so one can only imagine how egregious the preliminary script must have been. This cardboard muscle man adventure springs no surprises on its audience, except for the automobile tire that appears in the garbage dump where Wynorski staged a scene and candidly admits that he missed during lensing. The sword fights lack energy, and the amateurish acting, particularly by Monique Gabrielle, is laughable. <br /><br />The first scene has our hero acting like Indiana Jones as he sneaks into a castle (the shot is lifted from Corman's own movie \"The Terror,\" to steal a gem but then has to fight his way out. Since film boasts only the most minimal of budgets, lensed as it was on location in Argentina to lower costs, \"Deathstalker 2\" resembles a studio bound television comedy drama with our hero and heroine bickering with each other as they defend themselves from the adversaries. Like the original \"Deathstalker,\" \"Deathstalker 2\" pits our hero against an evil sorcerer, Jarek the Sorcerer (John Lazar of \"Scorpion\") who has magical powers. He has made a double of Princess Evie (Monique Gabrielle), cast Evie out to roam the kingdom, installed the double on the throne, and rules the kingdom. Reena, ostensibly calling herself a seer, recruits the 'prince of thieves, Deathstalker (John Terlesky of \"Vampirella\") to help her recover her throne. Meanwhile, an evil female warrior Sultana (Toni Naples of \"Munchie\") is looking to kill Deathstalker, too. <br /><br />Predictably, it's no picnic trying to slay Deathstalker as the nefarious Gen (Marcos Woinsky) learns. During one of the film's more spectacular moments, our hero and heroine ride a gauntlet of explosive arrows as Gen and his A-Team of miscreants try to kill him. The scene in the crypt where Deathstalker escapes a crushing wall and saves Evie from a crowd of zombies is about as good as this cheesy epic gets. The only other scene that matches this occurs when Jarek kills a henchman during a conversation using water fountains to communicate. Jarek shoves his sword into the fountain and kills his incompetent henchman on the other side. Later, a tribe of Amazon warrior women capture Deathstalker and force him to defend his honor in a trial by combat. The Amazons hate Deathstalker's reputation as a womanizer, and they square him off against a gigantic redhead who makes life miserable momentarily for Deathstalker.<br /><br />Like the original \"Deathstalker,\" the saving grace of \"Deathstalker 2\" is its self-effacing sense of humor. Unfortunately, there is not quite enough self-effacing humor to counteract the amateurish acting, formulaic script, and comic book bubble dialogue. The outtakes during the end credits are a bonus for anybody that hangs around long enough to enjoy them. Terlesky is more athletic than muscular. The horrendous hokum pays tribute to \"Rocky,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" \"Escape from New York,\" and \"Goldfinger.\" Once is more than enough to see this forgettable fodder.", "sentiment": 0}

Most of the film was spent in Arabia. It is very interesting how the film's release is timed - while the US is still in Iraq.

It's some kind of computer program, I just sign the check.<br /><br />He's very much both anti-Microsoft and anti-Bill Gates. He's also quite pro-Linux, the emblem of the \"Open Source\" movement whose adherents regard its underlying virtues with a devotion normally reserved by the religious for the icons of their faiths.<br /><br />So he wanted me to see \"Revolution OS,\" a documentary about the Linux operating system and the open source movement that spawned the increasingly important competitor to both Microsoft and Apple.<br /><br />This is a very interesting documentary which I, clueless as to the secrets of operating systems, readily understood. I watched it with the barest comprehension of Linux or the philosophy underlying the open source concept.<br /><br />Much credit to the filmmaker for not only explaining the seminal value of open source - the commitment to free interchange of ideas with minimal incorporation of legal protection for intellectual property - but for also succinctly allowing contrasting values and competing personalities screen time. This documentary is a very concise but excellent guide for the uninitiated into a world usually the arcane preserve of specialists most adept at talking to each other.<br /><br />The Open Source movement is a work in progress threatened by the real risk of those benefiting from openness legally protecting their own \"added value\" and thus, in a sense, betraying their benefactors. Several of those interviewed pursue their open source values almost as a creed, the commitment to computers taking the place of more traditional dogma.<br /><br />Anyone interested in a major intellectual counterpoint to the dominance of both Microsoft and the role of law in insuring proprietary benefits for innovators should see \"Revolution OS\": no manual required.<br /><br />8/10.", "sentiment": 0}
{"id": 38664, "text": "This film is indeed horrible. It makes the first American Kickboxer movie look quite good, something it definitely is not. The problems are many. I can't remember one single fight scene/action scene which was even remotely memorable or exciting. The characters never caught my interesting, and I wished they would disappear from my TV screen. It seems to be made by a bunch of amateurs. Maybe it really was a high school project, where some Z-grade actors/models got hired and were told to do a couple of karate moves. That's simply not enough to make a martial arts movie. And why the title \"American Kickboxer 2\"? OK, it's set in America, but it has nothing to do with the first movie at all. (and was the American Kickboxer title something that could attract interest? Who had heard of the first movie anyway?).<br /><br />A failure at everything it tries to achieve.", "sentiment": 0}
